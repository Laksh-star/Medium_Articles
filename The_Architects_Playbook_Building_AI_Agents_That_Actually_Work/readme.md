# Medium Agno Implementation Examples

This repository demonstrates how to build intelligent agents using **Agno**, a lightweight Python framework for quickly designing prompt-driven AI agents.

## üîç Competitive Product Analysis Agent - Your Market Intelligence Team!

This is the **highlighted example** in the notebook.  
It shows how to create a **market research agent** that analyzes a product and returns structured competitive insights.

### Code Example

```python
from agno import Agno

# Create the agent
agent = Agno(
    prompt="You are a market research analyst. For any product given, provide a summary, major competitors, and pricing trends.",
    system="Stay concise and provide bullet points."
)

# Query the agent
response = agent("Tesla Model 3")

# Print the result
print(response)
```

### What This Agent Does
- **Role**: Acts like a **market intelligence team**.
- **Input**: Any product name (e.g., "Tesla Model 3").
- **Output**: 
  - A **brief product summary**
  - A list of **major competitors**
  - **Pricing trends** in the market

### Why It Matters
- Useful for **business analysts**, **product managers**, and **marketers**.
- Helps in **quickly understanding** the competitive landscape without manual research.
- Can be extended for **industry-specific** or **region-specific** insights.
