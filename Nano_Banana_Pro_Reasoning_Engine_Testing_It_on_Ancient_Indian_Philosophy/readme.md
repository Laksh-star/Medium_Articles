# Nano Banana Pro Reasoning Experiments

This repo contains the prompts and one-shot image outputs used in my article  
**“Nano Banana Pro's Reasoning Engine: Testing It on Ancient Indian Philosophy.”**  
It documents how simple vs. structured prompts change Gemini 3 + Nano Banana Pro results on culturally grounded narratives.

## Contents

- `nachiketa/`
  - `prompt-simple.txt` – baseline “entire story + legend” prompt (Prompt A)
  - `prompt-structured.txt` – role + constraints + scenes prompt (Prompt B)
  - `output-simple.jpeg` – dense, wall-chart style poster
  - `output-structured.jpeg` – vertical narrative journey poster
- `yayathi/`
  - `prompt.txt` and `output.jpeg` – multi-stage life transformation test
- `garuda-purana/`
  - `prompt.txt` and `output.jpeg` – karma / afterlife visualization test
- `sabari/`
  - `prompt.txt` and `output.jpeg` – devotional mood and emotional composition test
- `Rama-squirrel'
- `ramayana-full-depiction` in Rembrandt style

## How to Use

- Open any `prompt*.txt` file and paste it into Nano Banana Pro (via Gemini / AI Studio).
- Compare your outputs with the corresponding `output*.png` files.
- Adapt the prompts as templates for your own culturally specific or educational visualizations.

## Notes

- All images here are **one-shot generations**—no manual retouching—so you can see realistic, “first pass” behavior.
- These assets are intended as **educational visual material** created with respect for source traditions, not as replacements for traditional artistic or ritual forms.
