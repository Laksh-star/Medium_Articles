DHARMA-VYĀDHA GĪTĀ
The Song of the Butcher
INTRODUCTION.
The principle teacher in this story is the butcher Dharma-vyādha who is mentioned and lauded by Pillai-lokācharya in his work Srivachanabhushana as an exemplar of Dharma. But to my knowledge none of the Srivaishnava acharyas have actually shone any light on this character or on his Dharma teachings. I have tried to address this deficit by translating and producing this work. I have also ehanced it with appropriate supportive quotes from the Bhagavad Gita.
This discourse is preceeded by a story. The learned brahmin Kaushika was sitting under a tree one day chanting the Vedas. A female crane sitting on a branch above shat on him. The brahmin became infuriated and flung an angry glance at her upon which she fell unconscious from the tree, hit the ground and died. The brahmin was filled with remorse for having been instumental in her death, and after consolling himself and cleaning up, he went to the nearby village on a begging round. He arrived at a certain house and the housewife told him to wait at the gate while she prepared the alms for him. In the meantime her husband arrived home, exhausted and hungry. She immediately set about attending to him - bringing him water to wash up and then lovingly serving him his lunch while she fanned him. After some time she noticed the Brahmin still standing at the gate waiting.
She finished serving her husband and then returned to give alms to the Brahmin Kaushika who was extremely irritated at being made to wait so long. He chastised her for her neglect of a learned brahmin, whereupon she said to him:—
"I am not the crane that you killed with your angry glances — they cannot affect me!" Astonished he asked her how she knew about that incident, she said that she'd gained clairvoyance simply from serving her husband with wrapt devotion. She then delivered a long lecture to him about the qualities of a true brahmin and finished off by telling him that since he was so deficient in knowledge of Dharma and indeed it's application he would do well to pay a visit to Dharma-vyādha the butcher of Mithila and learn Dharma from him.

mārkaṇḍeya uvāca cintayitvā tadāścaryaṁ striyā proktam aśeṣataḥ | vinindansa dvijo''tmānam āgaskṛta ivābabhau || 1 ||
Markandeya said:– "Continually reflecting upon that wonderful discourse of the housewife, Kaushika began to reproach himself [for his arrogance] and was consumed with remorse.
cintayānaḥ sa dharmasya sūkṣmāṁ gatimathābravīt | śraddadhānena vai bhāvye gacchāmi mithilāmaham || 2 ||
Contemplating on the subtle ways of Dharma, he said to himself, 'I should accept with reverence what the lady has said and should therefore, travel to Mithila.
kṛtātmā dharmavittasyāṁ vyādho nivasate kila | taṁ gacchāmyahamadyaiva dharmaṁ praṣṭuṁ tapodhanam || 3 ||
Without a doubt I'll find in that city a butcher, self-controlled and fully acquainted with the mysteries of Dharma.
tato jagāma mithilāṁ janakena surakṣitām | dharma setu samākīrṇāṁ yajñotsavavatīṁ śubhām || 4 ||
He travelled to Mithila, the capital of King Janaka and he beheld the city pervaded by the evidence of Dharma. A beautiful town resounding with the joyous sounds of ceremonies and festivities.
dharmavyādham apṛcchaccha sa cāsya kathito dvijaiḥ | apaśyattatragatvā taṁ sūnāmadhye vyavasthitam || 5 || mārga māhipa māṁsāni vikrīṇantaṁ tapasvinam | ākulatvācca kretṛṇām ekānte saṁsthito dvijaḥ || 6 ||
Arriving there, the Brahmin enquired about the virtuous butcher and was given directions by some twice-born persons. Arriving to the place indicated by them, the Brahmin Kaushika beheld the butcher seated in a butcher's yard and selling venison and buffalo meat and surrounded by a large throng of buyers, he stood at a distance and waited.
sa tu jñātā dvijaṁ prāptaṁ sahasā saṁbhramotthitaḥ | ājagāma yato vipraḥ sthita ekāntāsane || 7 ||
But the butcher, apprehending that the Brahmin had come to see him, suddenly rose from his seat and went to that secluded spot where he was standing.
vyādha uvāca abhivādaye tvāṁ bhagavan svāgataṁ te dvijottama | ahaṁ vyādho hi bhadraṁ te kiṁ karomi praśādhi mām || 8 ||
The butcher said:– "I humbly salute you, O venerable one! Welcome, I am the butcher. May you be well! Please instruct me as to what I may do for you.
ekapatnyā yaduktosi gaccha tvaṁ mithilāmiti | jānāmy etad ahaṁ sarvaṁ yad arthaṁ tvam ihāgataḥ || 9 ||
The chaste housewife has advised you to come to visit me. I know all of this and I also know for what purpose you have come."
3
śrutvā ca tasya tad vākyaṁ sa vipro bhṛṣavismitaḥ | dvitīyam idam āścaryam ityacintayata dvijaḥ || 10 ||
Hearing these words that Brahmin was filled with surprise. And he began to reflect inwardly, thinking, "This indeed, is the second marvel that I see!"
adeśasthaṁ hi te stānam iti vyādho'bravīd dvijam | gṛhaṁ gaccāva bhagavan yadi te rocate'nagha || 11 ||
The butcher then said to the Brahmin:– "you are now standing in place that is scarcely proper for you, O sinless one. If it pleases you, let us go to my home."
mārkaṇḍeya uvāca bāḍham ityeva taṁ vipro hṛṣṭo vacanam abravīt | agra tastu dvijaṁ kṛtvā sa jagāma gṛhaṁ prati || 12 ||
Markandeya continued:– "So be it," said the Brahmin gladly. And thereupon, the butcher proceeded towards his home with the Brahmin walking before him1.
praviśya ca gṛhaṁ ramyam āsanenābhi pūjitaḥ | arghyeṇa ca sa vai tena vyādhena dvijasattamaḥ' || 13 ||
And entering his abode, that looked delightful, the butcher honoured his guest by offering him a seat and water to wash his hands.
pādyamāchamanīyaṁ ca pratigṛhya dvijottamaḥ | tataḥ sukhopaviṣṭaṁ vyādhaṁ vacanam abravīt || 14 ||
And he also gave him water to wash his feet and face.2 And accepting these, that best of Brahmins sat at his ease and conversed with the butcher.
brāhmaṇa uvāca karmaitadvai na sadṛśaṁ bhavataḥ pratibhāti me | anutapye bhṛśaṁ tāta tava ghoreṇa karmaṇā || 15 ||
The Brahmin said:– "I really don't think that this profession is suitable for you. O butcher! I deeply regret that you should follow such a cruel trade."
vyādha uvāca kulocitam idaṁ karma pitṛ pairtāmahaṁ param | vartamānasya me dharme sve manyuṁ mā kṛthā dvija || 16 ||
The butcher said:– "This is my hereditary profession, I have inherited it from my father and grandfather. O priest, don't concern yourself about me adhering to the duties that belong to me by birth.
vidhātrā vihitaṁ pūrvaṁ karma svam anupālayan | prayatnāccha gurū vṛddhau śuśrūśe'haṁ dvijottama || 17 ||
Discharging the duties ordained for me beforehand by Brahma, I carefully serve my gurus and the senior citizens.
satyaṁ vade nābhyasūye yathāśakti dadāmi ca | devatātithi bhṛtyānām avaśiṣṭena vartaye || 18 ||
1 It is Hindu etiquette for the superior person to walk in front. 2 It is also etiquette to offer water for drinking – but Brahmins would not accept water from the hands of a low- caste butcher.
4

O best of Brahmins! I always speak the truth, and never envy others; and I give charity to the best of my ability. I live upon what remains after serving the gods, strangers3, and the employees that depend on me.
na kutsayāmyahaṁ kiñcin na garhe balavattaram | kṛtam anveti kartāraṁ purā karma dvijottama || 19 ||
I never speak ill of anything, small or great. O Brahmin, the actions (karma) of a former life always follow the doer.
kṛṣi go-rakṣya vāṇijyam iha lokasya jīvanam | daṇḍanītis-trayo vidyā tena loko bhavatyuta || 20 ||
Agriculture, rearing of cattle, trade, politics and the study and teaching of the Vedas (trai- vidya) are the principle means of material existence in the world.
karma śūdre kṛṣir vaiśye saṁgrāmaḥ kṣatriye smṛtaḥ | brahmacarya tapo mantrāḥ satyaṁ ca brāhmaṇe sadā || 21 ||
Service has been ordained to be the vocation of the Sudra. Agriculture for the Vaishyas, and defence for the Kshatriyas, while the practice of the Brahmacharya vow4, asceticism, recitation of mantras and truthfulness have been ordained for the Brahmins.
rājā praśāsti dharmeṇa svakarma niratāḥ prajāḥ | vikarmāṇaśca ye kecit tān yunakti svakarmasu || 22 ||
The king should rule justly over subjects adhering to their proper duties; while he should rectify those that have neglected their bounded duties.
bhetavyaṁ hi sadā rājñāṁ prajānām adhipā hite | mārayanti vikarmasthaṁ lubdhā mṛgamiveśubhiḥ || 23 ||
Rulers should always be feared, because they are the lords of their subjects. They restrain those subjects of theirs that neglect their obligations just as they restrain the motions of the deer by means of their arrows.
rājāno hi svadharmeṇa śriyam icchanti bhūyasīm | sarveśām eva varṇānāṁ trātā rājā bhavatyuta || 24 ||
Politicians dedicated to their profession should work hard to maximise the economy of the country through the protection and nurturing all the orders of society.
pareṇa hi hatān brahman varāha mahiśānaham | na svayaṁ hanmi viprarṣe vikrīṇāmi sadā tvaham || 25 ||
As regards myself, I never intentionally harm any living being but I do sell pork and buffalo meat. I sell meat of animals that have been slaughtered by others.
na bhakṣayāmi māṁsāni ṛtugāmī tathāhyaham | sadopavāsī ca tathā naktabhojī sadā dvija || 26 ||
I never eat meat myself; and have sex with my wife only in the appropriate season; I always fast during the day, and eat, O priest, in the night.
Commentary
According to the Sacred Law only women have conjugal rights known as the Ritu. The
3 Atithi — refers to someone, a guest, who arrives at one's home without being invited. 4 Brahmacharya is a vow of studentship — Brahma = the divine, charya = moving in.

Ritu which means “season” are the 12 nights after the commencement of the menstrual cycle, excluding the first 3 or 4. It is laid down in many sacred texts that it is the duty of the husband to have sex with his wife during this period. This is known as Ritu-gamana. After the menstrual blood has ceased to flow, the woman is advised to purify herself by bathing and wearing clean clothes, she should approach her husband and say:– ṛtum dehi – "give me my conjugal rights" — the husband has no right to refuse such a request. (Mbh 13:162.41). In fact a refusal to oblige is considered a heinous sin leading to hell. (Parasara 4:12). It is also taught that having sex in the Ritu is one of the virtues that lead to heaven. (Mbh. 8:144.13-14) The Sacred Law goes even further and declares that the married couple who only have sex during the Ritu are to be considered as celibate (brahmacaris). (Mbh. 12:221.11)
aśīlaścāpi puruṣo bhūtvā bhavati śīlavān | prāṇi-hiṁsāratiścāpi bhavate dhārmikaḥ punaḥ || 27 ||
Even though the vocation one pursues may lack virtue, yet the practitioner may be unimpeachable. So even a butcher who slaughters animals for a living may be an exemplary person.
Commentary
People should not be judged by their profession but the quality of their character. There are many examples in Hindu literature of prostitutes that were elevated characters. Pingala of Videha in Bhagavatam and Kanakamba a courtesan who was a disciple of Ramanuja.
yecaiva māṁ praśaṁsanti yeca nindanti mānavāḥ | sarvān supariṇītena karmāṇā toṣayāmyaham || 28 ||
Regarding myself, I always seek to please with acts of kindness, those that praise me, as also those that speak ill of me.
śaktyā'nnadānaṁ satataṁ titikṣā dharma nityatā | yathārhaṁ pratipūjā ca sarvabhūteśu vai dayā || 29 || tyāgān nānyatra martyānāṁ guṇās tiṣṭhānti pūruṣe |
Giving food to the best of one's ability to the hungry, endurance of heat and cold and the other pairs of opposites, steadyness in the practice of Dharma, giving respect and honour to the deserving and compassion for all creatures — these attributes can never be found in a person without an innate desire for renouncing the world.
mṛṣāvādaṁ pariharet kuryāt priyam ayācitaḥ | na ca kāmān na saṁrambhān na dveśād dharmam utsṛjet || 30 ||
One should avoid falsehood in speech, and should do good without being urged to. One should never abandon Dharma from lust, from anger, or from malice.
priye nātibhṛṣaṁ hṛṣyed apriye na ca saṁjvaret | na muhyed arthakṛcchreṣu na ca dharmaṁ parityajet || 31 ||
On obtaining an object of desire one should not be elated, nor grieve immoderately at a loss. One should never feel depressed when financially challenged, and never abandon the path of Dharma.
karma cet kiñcid anyat syād itaran na tad ācaret || 32 || yat kalyāṇam abhidhyāyet tatrātmānaṁ niyojayet |
6
If at any time one does what is wrong in error, it should never be repeated. One should always strive mentally to do that which is beneficial to oneself.
na pāpaṁ prati pāpaḥ syāt sādhur eva sadā bhavet | ātmanaiva hataḥ pāpo yaḥ pāpaṁ kartum icchati || 33 ||
One should never seek revenge, but should always deal honestly others [friends or foes]. That wretched individual who desires to do what is dishonest, commits spiritual suicide.
karma caitad asādhūnāṁ vṛjinānām asādhukam na dharmostīti manvānāḥ śucīnava hasanti ye || 34 ||
aśraddadhānā dharmas te naśyanti na saṁśayaḥ | mahādṛtirivādhmātaḥ pāpo bhavati nityadā || 35 ||
Those malicious people who wilfully harm others, disregarding ethical principles, mock the good and the pure saying:– 'There is no Dharma' - undoubtedly they meet with destruction through their unethical behaviour. They are like a blacksmith's bellows – inflated with arrogance but empty of substance.
sādhuḥ sannatimān eva sarvatra dvijasattama | mūḍhānām avaliptānām asāraṁ bhāṣitaṁ bhavet | darśayanty-antarātmānaṁ divā rūpam ivāṁśumān || 36 ||
Noble-born people are always polite and considerate. The unscrupulous are filled with pride and folly and their speech lacks substance. It is their inner self that reveals their true nature like the sun that reveals forms during the day.
na loke rājate mūrkhaḥ kevalātmapraśaṁsayā | apiceha mṛjāhīnaḥ kṛta vidyaḥ prakāśate || 37 ||
The fool cannot excel in the world by means of self-praise. The wise, however, even if they be destitute of physical attributes, display their radiance by refraining from speaking ill of others and well of themselves.
abruvan kasyacin nindāmātma pūjām avarṇayan | na kaścid guṇasaṁpannaḥ prakāśo bhuvi dṛśyate || 38 ||
No example, however, can be met with, in this world, of a person achieving excellence by demeaning others while self-promoting.
vikarmaṇā tapyamānaḥ pāpād viparimucyate | na tat kuryāṁ punar iti dvitīyāt parimucyate || 39 ||
If one regrets a wrong done, that feeling of remorse effaces the guilt. The firm resolution of never doing it again saves one from future accountability.
karmaṇā yena teneha pāpāt dvijasattama | evaṁ śrutir iyaṁ brahman dharmeṣu pratidṛśyate || 40 ||
One may also compensate for bad Karma by performing any of those expiations ordained in the scriptures without attachment or craving for selfish outcomes.
Commentary
The Dharma Śāstras give numerous methods of expatiating bad Karma - through going on arduous pilgrimages, performing charity, social service, reciting specific mantra, undertaking a program of austerities of some sort like fasting and self-deprivation, and the performing rituals like kuṣmāṇḍa homa, Brahmakūrca homa etc.

pāpani buddhveha purā kṛtāni sva-dharma-śīlo'pi vihanti paścāt | dharmo brahman nudate puruṣāṇām yat kurvate pāpam iha pramādāt || 41 ||
A noble person who commits an offence through error can then expatiate that misdeed through compensatory good works. Dharma itself will exculpate those transgressions that one may occasionaly commit through ignorance or neglect.
Commentary
It is not possible for one to remain vigilant 24/7 and everyone no matter how noble and committed to Dharma at some time or other lapses and makes error. But the accumulation of merit that one has achieved through sustained practice (Dharma) will negate those minor acts of impropriety.
pāpaṁ kṛtvā hi manyeta nāhamasmīti pūruśaḥ | taṁ tu devāḥ prapaśyanti svasyaivāntarapūruśaḥ || 42 ||
If a person commits sin thinking that he is not accountable and will not be discovered is wrong! The gods behold everyone and everything that one does, also the Supreme Being (antaryāmi) that is within every one's heart is also the silent witness.
cikīrśed eva kalyāyaṇaṁ śraddadhāno'nasūyakaḥ | vasanasyeva chidrāṇi sādhūnāṁ vivṛṇoti yaḥ | apaśyannātmano doṣān sa pāpaḥ pretya naśyati || 43 ||
A serious spiritual aspirant stops taking note of the faults of others and desires only the wellbeing of all creatures. The wicked who turn their attention away from their own faults and focus on those of others are like people having rips in their garment. [The tears keep on getting bigger until eventually the person is naked]. Those who refuse to acknowledge their own faults can never achieve happiness either in this life or the next!
pāpaṁ cet puruṣaḥ kṛtvā kalyāṇam abhipadyate | mucyate sarva pāpebhyo mahābhreṇeva candramāḥ || 44 ||
If a person performs compensatory good deeds after committing a sin, without doubt he is purified and resplendent like the moon emerging from thick clouds.
Commentary
Sin or pāpa is defined as any act which causes suffering to another being and virtue or puṇya is that which contributes to the benefit and wellbeing of others.
paropakāra puṇyāya pāpāya parapīḍanam
yathā'dityaḥ samudyan vai tamaḥ sarvaṁ vyapohati | evaṁ kalyāṇam ātiṣṭhan sarva pāpaiḥ pramucyate || 45 ||
Just as the rising sun, dispels all darkness of the night. So, O best of Brahmins, good works done without selfish motives liberate one from all negative karma.

yoga-saṁnyasta karmāṇaṁ jñāna saṁcchinna saṁśayam | ātmavantaṁ na karmāṇi nibadhnanti dhanañjaya || 41 ||
O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), actions do not bind one who has renounce them through Karma Yoga and whose doubts are dispelled by knowledge, and who therefore possesses a steady mind. Gita 4:41)
pāpānāṁ viddhyadhiṣṭhānaṁ lobhamohau dvijottama | lubadhāḥ pāpaṁ vyavasyanti narā nātibahuśrutāḥ || 46 ||
O best of Brahmins greed (lobha) is said to be the repository of all sins, the greedy person who has not listened to the sound teachings of the scriptures will engage in malfeasance [to satisfy their greed].
adharmā dharma-rūpeṇa tṛṇaiḥ kūpā ivāvṛtāḥ | yeṣāṁ damaḥ pavitrāṇi pralāpā dharma-saṁśritaḥ | sarvaṁ hi vidyate teṣu śiṣṭācāraḥ sudurlabhaḥ || 47 ||
Villainous people generally cover themselves with a thin virtuous exterior, like wells which are camouflaged by long grass. Outwardly they seem to possess self-control and uprightness and indulge in giving lectures on virtue. Indeed, the appear to possess all good qualities but true sincerity is lacking.

mārkaṇḍeya uvāca sa tu vipram athovāca dharmavyādho yudhiṣṭhira | yad ahaṁ hy ācare karma ghoram etad asaṁśayam || 1 ||
Markandeya continued:– The pious butcher, O Yudhishthira, then said to that Brahmin, "Undoubtedly the work I do is horrid, O Brahmin.
vidhis tu balavān brahman dustaraṁ hi purā-kṛtam | purākṛtasya pāpasya karma doṣo bhavaty ayam || 2 ||
Destiny is all-powerful and it is difficult to evade the consequence of our past actions. And this is due to the Karma arising out of actions committed in a former life.
doṣasyaitasya vai brahman vighāte yatnavān aham | vidhinā vihite pūrvaṁ nimittaṁ ghātako bhavet || 3 ||
But, I am always assiduous in mitigating any harm to others. The Deity is in fact the one that takes away life, the executioner acts only as an intermediary agent.
Commentary
The example given alludes to a court of justice where a criminal is sentenced to death by the judge. The executioner is performing a duty and has a diminished moral accountability. The judge is the one who is actually the cause of death. Likewise Lord Yama determines when people will die according to their karmas, the actual cause of death is only incidental.
nimittabhūtā hi vayaṁ karmaṇo 'sya dvijottama | yeṣāṁ hatānāṁ māṁsāni vikrīṇāmo vayaṁ dvija || 4 ||
teṣām api bhaved dharma upabhogena bhakṣaṇāt | devatātithibhṛtyānāṁ pitṝṇāṁ pratipūjanāt || 5 ||
And we, O good Brahmin, are only such agents in regard to karma. Those animals that are slaughtered and whose meat I sell, also acquire indirect good karma, because (with their flesh), gods and guests and dependents are satiated and the manes are propitiated.

Commentary
kratau śrāddhe niyukto vā anaśnan patati dvijaḥ | mṛgyopārjitaṁ māṁsam abhyarcya pitṛdevatāḥ || kṣatriyo dvādaśonaṁ tata krītvā vaiśyo’pi dharmataḥ | dvijo jagdhvā vṛthā māṁsam abhyarcya pitṛdevatāḥ ||
A Brahmin involved in the celebration of a yajña [in which animals are slaughtered)] becomes degraded by not taking meat (as prasādam). A Kshatriya should eat the cooked flesh of a quarry after having offered it to the gods and pitris. A Vaishya can take meat lawfully having bought it, after offering it to the pitris and devatas. (Vyāsa Smriti 3:57)
oṣadhyo vīrudhaś cāpi paśavo mṛga-pakṣiṇaḥ | annādya bhūtā lokasya ity api śrūyate śrutiḥ || 6 ||
It is said authoritatively by the Shastras that herbs and vegetables, deer, birds and wild animals constitute the food of all creatures.
ātma māṁsa pradānena śibir auśīnaro nṛpaḥ | svargaṁ sudurlabhaṁ prāptaḥ kṣamāvān dvijasattama || 7 ||
And king Sibi, the son of Usinara, of great forbearance attained heaven which is hard to reach, by giving away his own flesh.
Commentary
Indra and Agni took the forms of a hawk and a dove to test the virtue of King Sibi. The dove pursued by the hawk took refuge on the lap of the king. The hawk requested the dove be returned to him as his legitimate food. The king refused and offered to give his own flesh in exchange for that of the dove. He weighed his own flesh against the weight of the dove and no matter how much he cut off the dove was still heavier. He eventually climbed onto the scale himself. The devas were delighted and blessed him.

And in days of yore, O Brahmin, two thousand animals used to be killed every day in the kitchen of king Rantideva; and he acquired unrivalled reputation by distributing food with meat every day.
Commentary
In the Mahabharata and the Puranas, it is mentioned that Rantideva was a pious and benevolent king of the lunar race. Rantideva possessed enormous wealth. He was very religious, and charitable and profuse in his sacrifices. He had about two hundred thousand cooks to prepare food for the beggars and poor people. Rantideva had two thousand head of cattle slaughtered daily for use in his kitchen, and fed innumerable beggars daily with food.
He once fasted for forty-eight days and was tested by Trinity. The Trimūrti came in the disguise of a Brahmin, then a Sudra, and finally as a Chandala. Each of the gods begged portions of the food that the king was using to break his fast. Finaly they left him without even water to drink. Because he tolerated all this patiently, he received the blessings of the Supreme Lord.
cāturmāsyeṣu paśavo vadhyanta iti nityaśaḥ | agnayo māṁsa-kāmāś ca ity api śrūyate śrutiḥ || 10 ||
10
For the performance of the four-monthly rites animals ought to be sacrificed daily. 'The sacred fire is fond of animal food,' — this saying has been handed down to us.
yajñeṣu paśavo brahman vadhyante satataṁ dvijaiḥ | saṁskṛtāḥ kila mantraiś ca te 'pi svargam avāpnuvan || 11 ||
And at the Vedic sacrifices, animals are invariably killed by Brahmins, and these animals being purged by the incantation of mantras, go to heaven.
Commentary
Rāmānuja's commentary on Brahma Sūtra-25-asuddham iti cet na śabdāt- 3-1-25 Regarding the animal killed in yajña the śruti says:– 'hiraṇya-śarīra ūrdhvah svarga- lokam eti, — "attaining a golden body it (the animal) goes to heaven". Because it releases the jīva from body of a lower species and makes it ascend to heaven it is beneficial and not himsa. That action which secures an exalted status even if it involves a
little pain it is definetly considered beneficial. The mantra which is pronounced while sacrificing the animal also declares
"na vā u etan mriyase na ripyasi devān ideṣi patibhih sugobhih; yatra santi sukrto nāpi duṣkṛtaḥ, "You do not die; you go to the gods on easy paths; where the virtuous go, not evil-doers."
Just as a treatment for an injury, even if involves a little pain does a lot of good so too the animal sacrifice in yajñas benefit the jīva that inhabits the body of the animal.
atrāpi vidhir uktaś ca munibhir māṁsa-bhakṣaṇe | devatānāṁ pitṛṇāṁ ca bhuṅkte dattvā tu yaḥ sadā | yathā vidhi yathā śraddhaṁ na sa duṣyati bhakṣaṇāt || 12 ||
And in this matter of animal food, this rule has been laid down by Munis:– Whoever partakes of animal food after having first offered it duly and respectfully to the gods and the manes, is not polluted by the act.
Commentary
Manu 5:40 - 43. Herbs, trees, cattle, birds, and (other) animals that have been destroyed for sacrifices, receive (being reborn) higher existences. On offering the honey-mixture – madhu-parka (to a guest), at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the Ancestors, but on these occasions only, may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu has proclaimed. A twice- born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state. A twice-born man of virtuous disposition, whether he dwells in (his own) house, with a teacher, or in the forest, must never, even in times of distress, cause an injury (to any creature) which is not sanctioned by the Veda.
amāṁsāśī bhavaty evam ity api śrūyate śrutiḥ | bhāryāṁ gacchan brahmacārī ṛtau bhavati brāhmaṇaḥ | satyānṛte viniścitya atrāpi vidhir ucyate || 13 ||
And such a man is not at all considered to have partaken of animal food, even, as a Brahmacharin having intercourse with his wife during the post-menstrual period, is nevertheless considered to be a good Brahmin. After consideration of the propriety and impropriety of the matter, this rule has been laid down.
saudāsena purā rājñā mānuṣā bhakṣitā dvija | śāpābhibhūtena bhṛśam atra kiṁ pratibhāti te | svadharma iti kṛtvā tu na tyajāmi dvijottama || 14 ||
11
King Saudasa, when under a curse, often used to eat humans5; what is your opinion of this matter? And knowing this to be my svadharma due to the consequence of my previous Karma, I will never leave this job.
purā kṛtam iti jñātvā jīvāmy etena karmaṇā | svakarma tyajato brahmann adharma iha dṛśyate | svakarma nirato yas tu sa dharma iti niścayaḥ || 15 ||
I obtain my livelihood from this profession. The forsaking of one's hereditary occupation is considered to be a misdemeanour, and the act of sticking to one's own profession is without doubt a meritorious act.
pūrvaṁ hi vihitaṁ karma dehinaṁ na vimuñcati | dhātrā vidhir ayaṁ dṛṣṭo bahudhā karma nirṇaye || 16 ||
The Karma of a former existence never leaves any one. And in determining the multiple ways in which Karma operates, this was not lost sight of by the Brahma.
draṣṭavyaṁ tu bhavet prājña krūre karmaṇi vartatā | kathaṁ karma śubhaṁ kuryāṁ kathaṁ mucye parābhavāt || 17 ||
A person who is operating under the influence of negative Karma, must always consider how that negativity can be counteracted and how one can escape from a detrimental situation.
karmaṇas tasya ghorasya bahudhā nirṇayo bhavet | dāne ca satyavākye ca guruśuśrūṣaṇe tathā || 18 || dvijāti pūjane cāhaṁ dharme ca nirataḥ sadā | ativādātimānābhyāṁ nivṛtto 'smi dvijottama || 19 ||
Reflecting on this again and again, one will eventually discover a means of compromise. Accordingly, O good priest, I am charitable, truthful, assiduous in attending on my gurus, full of respect towards Brahmins, devoted to Dharma and free from arrogance and excessive (idle) talk.

Agriculture is considered to be a praiseworthy occupation, but it is well-known that even there, great harm is done to animal life; and in the operation of digging the earth and ploughing, countless creatures lurking in the ground and various other forms of animal life are destroyed. What do you think of that?
dhānyabījāni yāny āhur vrīhy ādīni dvijottama | sarvāṇy etāni jīvanti tatra kiṁ pratibhāti te || 20 ||
O good Brahmin, rice, wheat and all other seeds that are consumed are all living organisms. What is your opinion on this matter?

5 The Mahabharata narrates that Saudasa also known as Kalmashapada cultivates an intense hatred for Vashishtha and his sons — he ate the 99 brothers to seek his vengeance.

Men hunt wild animals and kill them and partake of their meat. They also cut up trees and herbs; but, O Brahmin, there are numerous living creatures in trees, in fruits, as also in water; don't you think so?
sarvaṁ vyāptam idaṁ brahman prāṇibhiḥ prāṇi-jīvanaiḥ | matsyā grasante matsyāṁś ca tatra kiṁ pratibhāti te || 23 ||
This whole creation, O Brahmin, is full of life, sustaining itself with food derived from other living things. Have you not noticed that fish prey upon other smaller fish.
sattvaiḥ sattvāni jīvanti bahudhā dvijasattama | prāṇino 'nyonyabhakṣāś ca tatra kiṁ pratibhāti te || 24 ||
Various species of animals prey upon other species, and there are species, the members of which prey upon each other. What's your opinion of this?
caṅkramyamāṇā jīvāṁś ca dharaṇī saṁśritān bahūn | padbhyāṁ ghnanti narā vipra tatra kiṁ pratibhāti te || 25 ||
People, O Brahmin, while walking about here and there, kill numerous little creatures lurking in the ground by trampling on them — what do you think?
upaviṣṭāḥ śayānāś ca ghnanti jīvān anekaśaḥ | jñānavijñānavantaś ca tatra kiṁ pratibhāti te || 26 ||
And even wise and enlightened people unknowlingly destroy animal life in various ways, even while sleeping or reposing themselves. What have you to say about this?
jīvair grastam idaṁ sarvam ākāśaṁ pṛthivī tathā | avijñānāc ca hiṁsanti tatra kiṁ pratibhāti te || 27 ||
The earth and the air all swarm with living organisms, which are unconsciously destroyed by people from mere ignorance. Is this not so?

The injunction that people should not do harm to any creature (ahimsa), was ordained of old by men, who were ignorant of biological facts. For there is no one on the face of this earth, who is free from doing injury to creatures. After full consideration, the conclusion is irresistible that there is not a single person who is free from the sin of harming animal life.
ahiṁsāyāṁ tu niratā yatayo dvijasattama | kurvanty eva hi hiṁsāṁ te yatnād alpatarā bhavet || 29 ||
Even the sages whose vow is to do harm to no creature, inflict injury on animal life. Only, on account of greater attention and mindfulness on their part, the harm is less.
ālakṣyāś caiva puruṣāḥ kule jātā mahāguṇāḥ | mahāghorāṇi karmāṇi kṛtvā lajjanti vai na ca || 30 ||
Men of noble-birth and outstanding qualities perpetrate wicked acts in defiance of all, of which they are not at all ashamed.

Relatives are not pleased with the progress and advancement of other relatives, and abuse them at every turn. And fools considering themselves learned and superior denounce their preceptors.

This reversal of the natural order of things, O good Brahmin, is seen everywhere in this world. What is your opinion of Adharma masquerading as Dharma?

The butcher replied:– "O best of Brahmins, yajñas, charity, asceticism6, the the study of the Vedas, and Truth — these five purifying deeds are integral aspects of conduct that is called virtuous.

Having subjugated self-referent desire7 and anger, arrogance, avarice and crookedness, they that take pleasure in Dharma for its own sake, are regarded as really virtuous and worthy of the approbation of virtuous persons.
6 Tapa or tapas is a difficult word to translate it means, austerity, self-control, self-deprivation, meditation, forebearance, stoicism etc.

These people who are devoted to yajñas; and the study of the Vedas have no independent behaviour — they only follow the examples of the honest and the good. This indeed, is the second attribute of the virtuous.

Serving the gurus, adhering to truth, generosity and freedom from anger, these four, O Brahmin, are inseparably connected with behaviour that is virtuous.

The essence of the Vedas is Truth8: the essence of Truth is self-control, and the essence of self-control is abstention from material indulgences. These are all aspects of behaviour that is virtuous.

They who follow the deluded fools that mock the forms of Dharma prevailing in society, are dragged to their destruction for walking on such an eroneous path.

They, however, are virtuous who are engaged in making positive resolutions, who are devoted to the teachings of the Vedas and abstention from material pleasures, they in fact tread on the path of Dharma and adhere to the true Dharma.

They who are obedient to the instruction of their preceptors, and who reflect upon the meaning of the scriptures with patience and attentiveness are said to be behaving in a virtuous manner. It is these that are said to be properly guided by their higher intelligence.

Forsaking those that reject the moral authority of the Vedas9, those that transgress limits, those that are of malefic disposition, those that live in iniquity and vice — apply yourself to accumulating knowledge while reverencing those that are virtuous.
7 Kāma literally means "desire" and is often translated as lust. I think a better understanding of the sense in which it is used is "self-referent desire" all those cravings that have onself in mind, regarding the other as a means for one's gratification only. 8 Truth is said to operate when there is harmony between thought, speech and action.

Abstention from doing injury to any being and truthfulness are virtues highly beneficial to all creatures. Non-violence is a cardinal virtue, and is grounded in truth.

It is the dictum of the elders that the Vedas are the ultimate authority in matters of Dharma. This is correct, but the ways of righteousness are subtle, diverse and infinite.

[According to the Vedas, Dharma is truth and Adharma is untruth] But when a life is at stake and in the matter of marriage, it is acceptable to tell an untruth. Untruth sometimes leads to the triumph of truth, and the latter declines into untruth.
Commentary
In the Karna Parva there is a story about another sage named Kaushika who had taken a vow of truth. One day some people fleeing from some robbers hid themselves in the jungle near the ashram. The robbers arrived at the ashram and enquired of Kaushika the whereabouts of the fugitives, and he devoted to his vow of truth, directed the robbers to

This is declared to be the distinct four-fold source of Dharma. (Manu 2:12)
their hiding place. The wicked merciless robbers caught the fugitves and murdered them all. After death Kaushika was sent to hell for his indiscretion.
In the case of marriage telling a white lie with good intent is permissible. If for example the bride was engaged before, or had an abortion and this fact becoming known to the suitors family would result in the cancellation of the proposal, telling a lie would not be an offence all other factors being equal.

The foolish, the unscrupulous and the fickle, are always swinging on a pendulum of happiness and sorrow. Neither learning lessons nor good morals, nor that personal exertion is not enough to succeed.
Commentary
The outcome of every project is dependant on a number of factors 1. the effort of oneself, 2. the effort of others, 3. circumstances, 4. the individual Karma of everyone involved as well as the group karma, 5. the grace of the gods. The only one of these factors that one can control is the effort that one can exert and this too is limited to capacity and ability. One is enjoined therefore to strive to the utmost but not to be concerned about the outcomes.

As a person casts off worn-out garments and puts on others that are new, so does the embodied Self cast off its worn-out bodies and enter into others that are new. (Gītā 2:22)

The butcher replied:– 'When the body dies the Self does not. They are mistaken, who foolishly say that all creatures die. There is in fact simply a change of tenement. The body is composed of five elements.
anyo hi nāśnāti kṛtaṁ hi karma manuṣyaloke manujas kaścit | yat tena kiñciddhi kṛtaṁ hi karma tad aśnute nāsti kṛtasya nāśaḥ || 26 ||
In this material world, no one experiences the consequences of someone else's Karma. Whatever a person does has consequences which that person alone experiences. The results of actions never perish.
supuṇyaśīlā hi bhavanti puṇyā narādhamāḥ pāpa-kṛto bhavanti | naro'nuyātastviha karmabhiḥ svais tataḥ samutpadyati bhāvitas taiḥ || 27 ||
Whatever one does, one is sure to reap the consequences thereof; for the consequences of the Karma that is done, can never be avoided. The virtuous become endowed with great virtues, and the sinful become the perpetrators of wicked deeds. People's actions follow them; and influenced by these, they are born again and again.
brāhmaṇa uvāca kathaṁ saṁbhavate yonau kathaṁ vā puṇya-pāpayoḥ | jātīḥ puṇyā hyapuṇyāś kathaṁ gacchati sattama || 28 ||
The Brahmin enquired:– "How does the Self take its birth, and what are the determinants of its becoming virtuous or sinful, and how does it come to belong to an advantaged or disadvantaged community?"
vyādha uvāca garbhādhāna samāyuktaṁ karmedaṁ saṁpradṛṣyate | samāsena tu te kṣipraṁ pravakṣyāmi dvijottama || 29 ||
The butcher replied:– "This unfathomable mystery seems to belong to the subject of procreation, but I shall briefly describe it to you.
yathā saṁbhṛta saṁbhāraḥ punar eva prajāyate | śubha kṛcchubha yonīṣu pāpa kṛt pāpayoniṣu || 30 ||
I will explain to you how the Self accumulates the seeds of Karma and takes rebirth. Those that do auspicious acts take higher births and the doers of inauspicious acts take lower births.
śubhaiḥ prayogair devatvaṁ vyāmiśrair mānuṣo bhavet | mohanīyair viyonīśu tvadhogāmī ca kilbiṣaiḥ || 31 ||
By the performance of virtuous actions one attains to the state of the gods, and by a combination of good and evil, one acquires a human birth; by indulgence in rank sensuality and similar demoralising practices, one is born in the lower species of animals, and by deplorable acts, one goes to the infernal regions.
jāti mṛtyu jarā duḥkhaiḥ satataṁ samabhidrutaḥ | saṁsāre pacyamānaśca doṣair ātma kṛtair naraḥ || 32 ||
21
dehino’smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā | tathā dehāntara prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati ||
Just as the embodied Self passes through childhood, youth and old age [pertaining to that body], so [at death] it passes into another body. A wise man is not confused thereby. (Gītā 2:13)
Because of the consequences of their own actions, jīvas are subjected to the miseries of birth, old-age and death. People are repeatedly born and die and are metamorphosed14 here in samsara.
tiryag yoni sahasrāṇi gatvā narakam eva ca | jīvāḥ saṁparivartante karma bandha nibandhanāḥ || 33 ||
Passing through thousands of animal births15 as also the infernal regions, the jīvas wander about, secured by the bonds of their own karma.
tataḥ karma samādatte punar anyan navaṁ bahu | pacyate tu punas tena bhuktvā'pathyam ivāturaḥ || 34 ||
In the human birth they accumulate a new series of Karma, and they consequently continue to suffer misery over again, like sick people partaking of unwholesome food;
ajasram eva duḥkhārto'duḥkhitaḥ sukhi saṁjñitaḥ | tato 'nivṛtta bandhatvāt karmaṇām udayād api | parikrāmati saṁsāre cakravad bahu vedanaḥ || 35 ||
Although they are thus afflicted, they consider themselves to be happy and at ease and consequently their [conditioned] constraints are not loosened and more new Karma arises; and suffering from diverse miseries they roam about in this samsara like a wheel.
sa cen nivṛtta bandhastu viśuddhaścāpi karmabhiḥ | tapo yoga samārambhaṁ kurute dvijasattama | karmabhir bahubhiś cāpi lokān aśnāti mānavaḥ || 36 ||
If they desire to liberate themselves from their [conditioned] constraints they purify themselves by their virtuous actions and begin the practise of self-restaint and yoga, then, O best of Brahmins, they attain the higher realms of bliss by these numerous acts of merit.
pāpaṁ kurvan pāpa-vṛttaḥ pāpasyāntaṁ na gacchati | tasmāt puṇyaṁ yatet kartuṁ varjayīta ca pāpakam || 37 ||
The malefactor who is addicted to vices, creates the vrittis which only increase the cycle of malefaction. Therefore we must strive to do what is virtuous and refrain from doing what is unrighteous.
Commentary
Vṛittis — Literally "Waves" in the consciousness. Every experience is associated with a number of factors; people, sounds, tastes, smells etc. If the experience is pleasurable or painful it makes an impression on the mind. That impression (samskāra) sinks into the citta — sub-conscious mind. After some time, days, months or even years, a trigger memory activates the dormant saṁskāra which then produces a desire to either repeat or avoid the experience. Repeated experience reinforces the saṁskāra. A reinforced saṁskāra or group of saṁskāras produce a vāsana or an habitual pattern of behaviour.
14 pacyamāna — means "cooked" i.e. prepared, matured and evolved through the karmic challenges and experiences. 15 We are told by Śāstra that we take 8,400,000 births in lower species before attaining a human birth.

īśvaraḥ sarva bhūtānāṃ hṛddeśo’rjuna tiṣṭhati | bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍāni māyayā ||
The Lord abides in the heart of every being, O Arjuna, spinning them round and round, by His power, as if they were mounted on a machine. (Gītā 18:61)

Some of these vāsanas are actively pursued and developed and are necessary for our sociological functioning.
Our personality is composed of a combination of all these saṁskāras and it is the sum total of unfufilled saṁskāras that comprise the cause for future rebirths.

A virtuous person who is free from criticizing the faults of others, who is always grateful and always strives to benefit other beings, attains wealth, virtue, happiness and heaven.
saṁskṛtasya ca dāntas niyatasya yatātmanaḥ | prājñāsyānantarā vṛttir ihi loke paratra ca || 39 ||
Those who are purified of misdeeds, wise, forbearing, consistant in righteousness, and self- restrained enjoy continuous felicity in this, as well as in the next world.
satāṁ dharmeṇa varteta kriyāṁ śiṣṭavad ācaret | asaṁkleśena lokasya vṛttiṁ lipseta vai dvijaḥ || 40 ||
People must follow the standard of virtue of the good and in all acts emulate the example of the righteous and follow a livelihood which causes no detriment to the world.
Commentary
According to the Lakshmi Tantra chapter 28;25, there are seven legitimate ways for a spiritual aspirant to make a living:—
1. daya — inheritance 2. labha — profit from honest commerce and trade. 3. kraya — purchase of land and assets for the purpose of speculation. 4. jaya — winning of prizes or money in a competition
5. prayoga — through the application of sacred learning and performing of rituals i.e., teaching and sacrificing for others in the case of brahmins and teaching in general and counselling and advising for those who are not brahmins.
6. karma yoga — through a profession or a vocational job serving others. 7. sat-pratigraha — the acceptance of lawful gifts — that is, unsolicited donations
from worthy sources.

There are many learned scholars who are well-educated in the Agamas and Shastras who are great role models. Following their example and instruction one should act. In this way there will be no confusion.

The wise delight in virtue and relying on dharma they live their lives. And in virtuous ways acquire wealth, which they then spend on the promotion and nurturing of Dharma. They see value in Dharma only.

Such people are known as Dharmātmas, and their minds are purified16, they are pleased with their friends and rejoice here and in the next life.

But enlightened people, O great Brahmin, are not satisfied with simply reaping the fruits of righteousness, they are fully cognisant of the instability of sensual pleasures and so cultivate dispassion.
prajñā-cakṣur nara iha dośaṁ naivānurudhyate | virajye yathā kāmaṁ na ca dharmaṁ vimuñcati || 46 ||
One who possesses the light of spiritual wisdom becomes indifferent to pain and pleasure and the attractions of the world and never abandons Dharma.
sarva tyāge ca yatate dṛṣṭvā lokaṁ kriyātmakam | tato mokṣe prayatate nānupāyād upāyataḥ || 47 ||
Observing that everything is impermanent, one tries to renounce everything and counting on more change andtransformation one devises means for the attainment of Liberation.
tapo niḥśreyasaṁ jantos tasya mūlaṁ śamo damaḥ | tena sarvān avāpnoti kāmān yān manasecchati || 48 ||
Meditation is the prime requisite for seekers of Liberation, its roots are equanimity and discipline. By this means one attains all the objects of desire.
indriyāṇāṁ nirodhena satyena ca damena ca | brahmaṇaḥ padam āpnoti yatparaṁ dvijasattama || 49 ||
But subduing the senses and practicing truthfulness and forbearance, one attains, O good Brahmin, the supreme peace of unification with Brahman.
brāhmaṇa uvāca indriyāṇīti yānyāhuḥ kāni tāni yata vrata |
nigrahaśca kathaṁ kāryo nigrahasya ca kiṁ phalam || 50 ||
The Brahmin again enquired:– "What are the senses that you speak of? How can they be subdued? What is the good of subduing them?
kathaṁ ca phalam āpnoti teśāṁ dharmabhṛtāṁvara | etad iccāmi tattvena dharmaṁ jñātuṁ sudhārmika || 51 ||
How does one get the benefit thereof? I would really like to understand this and to acquaint myself with the truth of this matter."
16 The "dirt" of the mind is:- kāma – selfish desire, krodha – anger, moha – delusion, mada – arrogance, lobha – avarice, mātsarya – malicious envy. The attenuation of these constitutes the purification of the mind.

The butcher said:– "People's minds are at first bent on the acquisition of knowledge [of their desired subject]. Once they've acquired knowledge, they indulge in their passions and desires – the frustration of which leads to anger.
tatas tad arthaṁ yatate karma cārabhate mahat | iṣṭānāṁ rūpa gandhānām abhyāsaṁ ca niśevate || 2 ||
And when an attraction arises to particular objects of pleasure – beauty, smell etc, they strive hard and engage in projects of great magnitude to obtain them, and then indulge in them to the maximum.
tato rāgaḥ prabhavati dveśaśca tadanantaram | tato lobhaḥ prabhavati mohaśca tadanantaram || 3 ||
Then follows attachment, then aversion to anything that threatens that, then avarice follows and then delusion [extinguishing of spiritual insight].
tato lobhābhibhūtasya rāga dveṣa hatasya ca | na dharme jāyate buddhir vyājād dharmaṁ karoti ca || 4 ||
And when people are thus influenced by avarice, and overcome by attraction and aversion, their intellect ceases to be guided by Dharma and if they do practise, it involves some deception.
vyājena carate dharmam arthaṁ vyājena rocate | vyājena sidhyamāneśu dhaneṣu dvijasattama | tatraiva ramate buddhis tataḥ pāpaṁ cikīrśati || 5 ||
Practising Dharma with hypocrisy, they are content to acquire wealth by dishonourable means. Because of the ease of acquisition they become enamoured of those unscrupulous methods, and begin a life of crime.

And when, O good Brahmin, their concerned and well-meaning friends and counsellors remonstrate with them, they are always ready with specious answers, which are neither sound nor convincing.

They cultivate the friendship of men of similar vicious character, and consequently they suffer misery in this life as well as in the next.

The Brahmin replied:– "You have given a clear exposition of Dharma which none else is able to expound. Your spiritual force is amazing, and you appear to me to be like a great Rishi."

This whole universe comprised of moving and unmoving creatures and consisting of the five elements is the physical manifestation of Brahman. There is nothing higher than this.
Commentary
The basic premise of Brahmanism is that the entire universe with its trillions of galaxies is the corporeal manifestation of the Divine Consciousness. The universe is not a "creation" but rather a projection or expansion of the Divine Nature — Brahman or Nārāyaṇa. The Nārāyaṇa Upaṇiṣad describes this as follows:—
"Nārāyaṇa is eternal. Brahma is Nārāyaṇa. Siva is Nārāyaṇa. Indra is Nārāyaṇa. Time is Nārāyaṇa. Space is Nārāyaṇa, the intermediate quarters also are Nārāyaṇa. That which is above is Nārāyaṇa. That which is below is Nārāyaṇa. That which is within and that which is without is Nārāyaṇa. The entire Universe which existed and that which will exist is Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa is the only One that is partless, immaculate, inconceivable, indescribable, pure and divine. There is no second. Whosoever knows Him thus, becomes Vishnu."

The earth, O Brahmin, has five qualities, water has four, fire has three and the air has two and space has one property.

Sound, touch, form, odour and taste — these five qualities belong to earth and thus the earth has the most properties.

And, O Brahmin, these fifteen properties inherent in the five elements, exist in all substances of which this universe is composed.
Commentary
The last five principles of the Sāṅkhya system are called Mahā-bhūtas, derived from the word mahā — “great” and the root bhū — "to be, to come into being, to exist." They are the five conditioned material states into which Cosmic Substance (Prakṛti) finally differentiates itself.
The five Elements (Mahā-bhūtas) are postulated in order to account for the channels through which the Subtle Elements (Tan-mātras) manifest themselves. For example the Tan-mātra of Sound cannot be heard if it does not have the Mahā-bhūta of Ether to serve as its channel.
Each Element or Sense-Particular (Mahā-bhūta) proceeds and is conditioned by the one immediately preceding it, and has an additional property of grossness.

And they are not opposed to one another; they exist, in proper combination and function in harmony.

When the body dies these elements disintegrate in regressive order and when manifesting in a progressive order.

Commentary
The universe alternates between states of evolution (sṛṣṭi) and involution (pralaya). In between these two active states there is a period of latency in which the universe is at perfect rest and all the elements and gunas are in perfect balance. When this balance is disturbed due to the influence of time (kāla) and the collective Karma of all the individual modes or sparks of consciousness which constitute the mass of jīvātmas — then the jīvas take on physical bodies in accordance with their individual Karmic propensities.
Everything is temporary and whatever has a beginning has an end. All evolution ends in involution. During the dissolution of the world, the products return by a reverse movement into the preceding stages of development, and ultimately merge back into Prakṛti.
Earth merges into its cause, water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space; and space into manas and manas into Ahaṅkāra (individuating Principle), and ahaṅkāra into Mahat (intellect), and Mahat back into Prakṛti. This is the process of involution. There is no end to Samsāra or the play of Prakṛti. This cycle of evolution and involution has neither a beginning nor an end.
When the universe returns to it's latency all the jīvas rest in a state of suspended animation - each still associated with its Karmic propensities in the form of saṁskāras — subliminal activators - seed impressions in the mind. Under the influence of Time these seeds begin to "sprout" leading to rebirth.
tatra tatrahi dṛṣyante dhātavaḥ pāñcabhautikāḥ | yairāvṛtam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagat sthāvara jaṅgamam || 10 ||
And these five elementary properties are found in every one of the components of the body and in everything of which all the mobile and immobile world is composed.
indriyair gṛhyate yadyat tattad vyaktam iti smṛtam | tad avyaktam iti jñeyaṁ liṅga grāhyam atīndriyam || 11 ||
Whatever is perceptible by the five senses, is called vyakta (manifest or knowable) and whatever is beyond the reach of the senses and can only be cognised by assumption, is known to be avyakta (unmanifest).
yathāsvaṁ grāhakānyeśāṁ śabdādīnām imāni tu | indriyāṇi tathā dehī dhārayan iha tapyate || 12 ||
When a person engages in the discipline of self-examination, after having subdued the senses which have their own proper objective play in the external conditions of sound, form, &c, then one is said to be performing tapas.
Commentary
The process of TAPAS or "heat generation" also known as austerity, is the subduing of the senses – which means restaining the senses from their natural pursuit of their targets i.e. the eye seeks forms, the nose smell, the tongue taste, the ears sound, the genitals sex. One engaged in tapas refrains from pursuing those natural inclinations which arise spontaneously. This restraining of the senses or directing the attention inward in yoga is known as pratyahāra — withdrawl of the attention and is the first stage of meditation.
When this process of meditation is continued one eventually achieves a state of expanded consciousness in which one realizes one's essential identity with the entire universe — in scientific terms the entire universe and our own bodies are all comprised of atoms. Thus from a quantum physics point of view we are all non-different.
29
The Jīvātman is a module of consciousness and the universe according to Vedānta, comprises of matter, energy and consciousness.
loke vitatam ātmānaṁ lokaṁ cātmani paśyati | parāvarajñaḥ yaḥ saktaḥ sa tu bhūtāni paśyati || 13 ||
One then perceives one's own essence pervading the universe, and the universe reflected in oneself. Thus one who realizes the Absolute Reality free from conditioning sees all the elements as pertaining to oneself.
paśyataḥ sarva bhūtāni sarvāvasthāsu sarvadā | brahmabhūtas saṁyogo nāśubhenopapadyate || 14 ||
A person on this level of spiritual realization sees essential sameness everywhere and always, with such a degree of spiritual integration (samyoga) one is never engaged in unskilful actions.

ajñāna mūlātmakaṁ kleśam ativṛttasya mohajam | loka vṛtti prakāśena jñāna-mārgeṇa gamyate || 15 ||
When a person has overcome the domination of spiritual nescience (ajñāna) from which suffering arises, he turns to spiritual knowledge and follows the path of wisdom.
Commentary
Ajñāna or spiritual nescience is the misidentification of the Self with the mind-body complex – it is rooted in the sense of self (asmita). We do not know who we really are and think we are the mind and the body and identify ourselves through our actions, thoughts and accessories – home, family, friends, profession etc. This misidentification is the cause of suffering (dukha).
anādi nidhanaṁ jantum ātma yoniṁ sadāvyayam | anaupamyam amūrtaṁ ca bhagavān āha buddhimān || 16 ||
The ātma is described by the enlightened beings as consciousness without beginning and without end, self-existent, immutable, incorporeal and incomparable.

This realization, O Brahmin, that you have enquired of me is only the result of self- discipline/meditation. And this self-discipline can only be acquired by subduing the senses. It cannot be otherwise.
indriyāṇyeva tat sarvaṁ yat svarga narakāvubhau | nigṛhīta visṛṣṭāni svargāya narakāya ca || 18 ||
The concept of heaven and hell are both dependent on our senses, when one is in control of one's senses then svarga is said to exist, lack of control is naraka.
Commentary
Svarga is a state of wellbeing and happiness whereas Naraka is a state of suffering and grief — these pertain to life here on earth and not necessarily to some post-death state. So it is through our intention and actions we can create these polar states wherever we are.
eśa yoga vidhiḥ kṛtsno yāvad indriya dhāraṇam | etan mūlaṁ hi tapasaḥ svargasya narakasya ca || 19 ||
The sustained practice of Yoga leads to the complete subjugation of the senses. This self- control is the genesis of happiness and sorrow.

When these five senses and the mind are under one's control, one is considered to be a jitendriya (self-controlled) and will never engage in vice and consequently corruption has no influence over one.

The physical body has been compared to a chariot, the jīvātman to the charioteer and the senses to horses. A skilled person drives about without confusion, like a quiet charioteer with well-broken horses.

An excellent driver is one who knows how to patiently control the reins of those wild horses — the six senses inherent in our nature.

When our senses become ungovernable like horses on the high road, we must patiently rein them in; for with patience, we are sure to get the better of them.

The tamas is characterised by illusion (spiritual), rajas incites (to action), and sattva is characterised by illumination, and on that account, it is said to be the best of them.

One who has a preponderance of tamas is under the influence of spiritual ignorance; foolish, idle, senseless and given to dreaming, unenergetic and swayed by anger and haughtiness.

And one who is out going, and vocal, skilful in managing others, free from envy, always active, full of hubris and of hot temperament, is said to be under the influence of rajas.

And one who is wise, patient, has no relish for starting new projects, free from fault-finding, and free from anger, wise and forbearing is said to be under the influence of sattva.
sāttvikastvatha saṁbuddho lokavṛttena kliśyate | yadā budhyati boddhavyaṁ lokavṛttaṁ jugupsate || 7 ||
One who is endowed with sattva, is full of knowledge and makes little effort to become involved in rajasic and tamasic activities. As knowledge develops into wisdom, the sattvic person becomes more disinterested in materialism.

A person, O Brahmin, may be born as a commoner, but if possessed of good qualities, one may attain the state of Vaiśya and similarly that of a Kṣatriya.

And if one is steadfast in rectitude, one may even become a Brahmin. I have described to you these virtues, what else do you wish to learn?'"
Commentary
There is the social classification according to profession which is the caste system known as jāti, and then there is classification of people according to proclivity known as varṇa. So for example the jāti criteria for a commoner (Sūdra) are:—
dānaṁ yajño'tha śuśrūṣā dvijātināṁ tridhā mayā | vyākhyātaḥ śūdra dharmo'pi jīvikā kāru-karmajā | tadvad dvijāti śuśrūṣā poṣaṇam kraya vikrayaiḥ |
The religious duties of the Sūdra are: works of charity and the performing of yajñas and bhagavad kainkaryam — serving the Lord. They earn a living from being artisans, tradesmen, craftsmen etc., from service professions, from nurturing and from selling and buying. (Markaṇḍeya Purāṇa 25:7-8)
The varṇa (character) – criteria are:—
dirgha vairam asūyā cāsatyā brāhmaṇa dūṣaṇam | paiśunyam nirdayatvā ca jānīyācchūdra lakṣaṇam ||
Bearing long grudges, envy, mendacity, reviling religious people, slander, and ruthlessness — these should be recognized as the characteristics of a Sudra. (Vasishtha 6:24)
Everyone is born as a Śūdra - there is no caste by birth.
janmanā jāyate śūdras samskārād bhaved dvija | veda pāṭhād bhaved vipro brahma jānātiti brāhmanaḥ ||
By birth everyone is a sudra, by undergoing the necessary transformative rituals one becomes twice-born – dvija, by study of the Vedas one becomes a vipra and by knowing the Supreme Truth one becomes a brāhmaṇa.
śṛṇu yakṣa kulam tāta na svadhyāyo na ca śātam | kāraṇam vā dvijatve ca vṛttam eva na samśayaḥ ||
Listen about caste, Yaksha dear, not study, neither learning is the cause of being "twice-born". Conduct alone is the basis, there is no doubt about it. (Aranya-parva 312. 106.)
33
na yonir nāpi saṁskāro na jñānaṁ na ca santatiḥ | kāraṇāni dvijatvasya vṛttam eva tu kāraṇam ||
The cause of brahminhood is not birth, nor sacraments, nor learning nor progeny — good conduct alone is the cause. (Anusasana Parva 143:50)

The one in whom are manifest truthfulness, generosity, forbearance, good conduct, absence of malice, austerity and compassion is a Brāhmaṇa according to the sacred tradition.

One in whom this conduct is manifest is a Brāhmaṇa, they should be considered as Sudras in which this code of conduct is absent. (Aranya-parva 180. 20, 27.)

It is the animating principle of all creatures, and it is the eternal puruṣa (ātman). It is the mind, intelligence and the ego, and it is the subjective locus of the various elements.
Commentary
There are two principal tattvas (factors) in the universe, viz., Mind (manas = sentience) and Prāṇa (breath). The Mind is inseperable from the Breath. Slow breathing calms the mind and rapid breathing agitates the mind. Prāṇa causes the digestion of food, turns it into nutrients which are transported by the blood to the tissues and the brain. The mind is

then able to think and do Brahma-Vicāra (philosophical enquiry). This is why prāṇāyama or breath-regulation is such an important aspect of Yoga practice.

Prāṇa is unmanifest, it has the quality of sattva, it is life, time, material nature and puruṣa. It is active in the awakened state of consciousness (jāgrata); and during dreaming (svapna) it creates the dream-world and moves about therein.
Commentary
In the dream state (svapna-avastha), the external awareness is shut down. In dream state, the senses are quiet and absorbed in the mind. Mind alone is active during dream. The mind operates in a free and unfettered manner. There is no land, no sea, no cars, no animals in dream; but the mind creates everything out of its own essence, out of the recollection of materials supplied from waking consciousness. The mind itself assumes the various forms of a bee, flower, mountain, vehicle, horse, river, etc. It is the subject and is the object as well. The seer and the seen are one in the dream state.
Every one has their own subjective mental world and dream-creations. The dream- creations are often related to Karmic impressions as well arising from the sub-conscious mind.

During the waking state one has the capacity to accomplish goals, one is proactive and causes others to act. When the prāṇa ceases to operate death occurs. The ātman leaves the body and takes on another.
Commentary
The individual Self (jīva) in the state of 'awakeness' (jāgrata) as long as it is in contact with the various external objects. By means of the modifications of the mind the jīva apprehends those external objects and identifies itself with the gross body which is also an object of perception.
evam tviha sa sarvatra prāṇena paripālyate | pṛṣṭhatastu samānena svāṁ svāṁ gatim upāśritaḥ || 8 ||
Thus, in this world prāṇa is everywhere and supports all life. When it takes the form of samāna then it has a different function perculiar to it.
Commentary
Samāna vāyu, or “balancing air,” is the transformation of the prāṇa when the prāṇa vāyu (the inward/upward-moving), meets the apāṇa vāyu (the outward/downward-moving). Located at the navel, Samāna vāyu governs agni, the digestive fire, or fire of purification. This digestive energy is efficient when prāṇa and apāna unite in samāna.
Samāna is related to the Manipura chakra located at the solar plexus. It is responsible for the processing and assimilation of all that is taken in — food, emotions, perceptions, and breath. Samāna assimilates these energies so that they can be used optimally. An imbalance of Samāna vāyu presents as health conditions including digestive disturbances, slow metabolism, malnourishment, or obesity.
35
basti mūle gudam caiva pāvakaṁ samupāśritaḥ | vahan mūtraṁ purīśaṁ vā'pyapānaḥ parivartate || 9 ||
And then samāna transforming itself into apāna vāyu, and operating in the urinary system and digestive tract expels the refuse matter of the body; urine and feces.
Commentary
Apāna is the prāṇa vāyu that involves the downward and outward flow of energy from the body. Apāna vāyu governs the outward flow of energy on the breath, the digestive elimination, and menstruation. The seat of apāna vāyu is the mūladhāra chakra, or the root chakra located at the perineum and pelvic floor. Not only does apāna guide the elimination of physical wastes, but also mental and emotional waste — that which no longer serves us.
The balanced function of apāna is important so that we are able to release negative energy, destructive thoughts, and toxins. Prāṇa and apāna work in a push-pull manner, each helping to balance the other.
Apāna is all about release — physical, mental, and emotional release. We must carefully mind what we take into our bodies and mind, we must equally cultivate the proper release of energy from our being.
prayatne karmaṇi bale sa eṣa triṣu vartate | udāna iti taṁ prāhur adhyātma-viduśo janāḥ || 10 ||
That same force is present in the three factors of effort, exertion and power, and in that condition it is called udāna-vāyu by persons learned in physical science.
Commentary
Udāna-vāyu, or “ascending air,” is the aspect of the prāṇa-vāyu that directs prāṇa from lower to upper chakras. Udāna-vāyu is the channel that leads from lower to upper levels of consciousness, carrying the energy of kuṇḍalini — the dormant energy awakened through yoga practice — up through the chakras as it ascends. It is primarily located between the heart and the head.
As the expressive vāyu, udāna governs the throat center. Communication and expression are particularly affected by this vāyu, as are the thyroid and parathyroid glands, which regulate metabolism. When udāna is balanced, we feel confident, assertive, and able to express ourselves articulately. The energy of udāna helps us to raise the bar, so to speak—to achieve our highest aspirations.
When udāna is out of balance, we find it difficult to communicate effectively. Loss for words, or too many words, or inappropriate speech burden our conversations. We feel unable to reach our ideals and find it difficult to understand those of others. We may feel defeated and unsure of ourselves.

And when manifesting itself by its presence at all the junctional points of the human system, it is known by the name Vyāna.
Commentary
Vyāna-vāyu, or “omnipresent air,” is the aspect of prāṇa-vāyu that integrates all vāyus. Vyāna-vāyu helps to balance the other four vāyus, and is present throughout the body. It is
36
not associated with any one area of the body, but rather the entire body, and even extends outward into the area surrounding the body, also known as the aura.
Nourishing and expansive, vyāna governs the movement of prāṇa through the nadis — the 72,000 energy channels that flow throughout the body. Vyāna also dictates the flow of blood and nutrients through the circulatory system, and the flow of chemical and electrical impulses through the nervous system, the movement of fluid through the lymphatic system, the movement of muscles and joints, and even the flow of thoughts and emotions — vyāna brings it all together.
dhātuṣvagnistu vitataḥ sa tu vāyu samīritaḥ | rasān dhātūṁśca dośāṁśca vartayan paridhāvati || 12 ||
And the internal heat is diffused throughout all the tissues of our system, and supported by these kinds of vāyus, it digests our food and nourises the tissues (dhātus) and the humours of our system.
Commentary
The seven dhātus are the seven tissues of the body. In English they are; plasma, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow / nerve, and reproductive tissue. In Sanskrit, they are rasa, rakta, māṁsa, medas, asthi, majja, and śukra respectively. These are the structures that make up the body. However, like most concepts in Vedic literature, they are much more than their one-dimensional definitions. They are integral to understanding the relationships of the tissues in the body, and they are sites that doṣas [imbalances] enter when they cause disease. An understanding of the seven dhātus is important to understanding pathology; what goes wrong in the body. When a doṣa enters a dhātu, a proper understanding of the dhātu helps the practitioner predict the symptoms that will manifest and provides clues to the best treatment.

And by the cooperation of Prāṇa and other vāyus, a reaction (combination) ensues, and the heat/energy generated thereby is the metabolism which causes the digestion of our food.
samānodānayor madhye prāṇapānau samāhitau | samarthitastvadhiṣṭhānaṁ samyak pacati pāvakaḥ || 14 ||
Between the Prāṇa and the Apāna are the Samāna and the Udāna. And the heat/energy generated by their cooperation causes the growth of the body (anabolism).
asyāpi pāyupayantas tathā syād guda saṁjñitaḥ | srotāṁśi tasmāj jāyante sarva prāṇeśu dehinām || 15 ||
The vāyu operating from the navel to the rectum is called Apāna; and from that, the srotas arise in the bodies of all creatures.
Commentary
Srotas, meaning 'channels', are present throughout the physical body as well as at the “invisible” or subtle level of the cells, molecules, atoms, and subatomic strata.
Srotas are present in all living things. These srotas convey nutrients, minerals, water, air and even thoughts. A block in the srotas is the beginning of diseases. Another definition of health is the unchecked flow of physical elements, thought and knowledge.
Only three srotas or channels are recognized by modern medical science they are the anna-vāha-srota (the digestive system), rakta-vāha-srota (circulatory system) and the prāṇa-vāha-srota (respiratory system).
37
pravṛttā hṛdayāt sarve tiryag ūrdhvam adhas tathā | vahanty anna rasānnāḍyo daśa prāṇa pracoditāḥ || 16 ||
The nāḍis issuing from the heart run upwards and downwards, as also in oblique directions; they carry the best essence of our food (rasa), and are acted upon by the ten Prāṇa airs.
Commentary
Rasa dhātu refers to the primary waters of the body. The word rasa means sap, juice, or liquid. In the physical body, rasa refers directly to the plasma, or non-cellular portion of the blood; the lymph, and interstitial fluids. As watery secretions, rasa dhātu relates indirectly to breast milk and menstrual fluid.
Rasa is more than fluid it is nourishment. Sugar and nutrients mix with the plasma and are carried by vyāna-vāyu to all of the tissues of the body. As such, when rasa-dhātu is healthy, a person feels satiated. The satisfaction one feels is both physical and psychological.

One who constantly practises concentration of mind soon beholds the Supreme Being which has no attributes, like a shining dazzling lamp (dispelling darkness).
Commentary
Has no attributes — the term used is nirātmānam — which means not having a "selfness". It is difficult to imagine what exactly the butcher meant by this. The two possible interpretations are that he is talking of the Nirguṇa Brahman — the Supreme Truth as devoid of all qualifications or it could also mean that the Supreme Reality Brahman does not conform to our personal and limitied conception of what Brahman actually is. We like to give a "personality" to the Supreme Being — but that personality can never be limited to our common definition and understanding of personality.

yuñjann-evaṃ sadā’tmānaṃ yogī niyata-mānasaḥ | śāntiṃ nirvāṇa paramāṃ mat-saṃsthām adhigacchati ||
Applying the mind constantly in this way, the Yogi, with a controlled mind, attains the peace which is the summit of beatitude and which abides in Me forever. (Gītā 6:15)
Avarice and anger must be subdued by all means, for this constitutes the purification of the world and is the means by which one can cross over to the other side of this sea of affliction.

One must protect one's spiritual practice from anger, and protect one's wealth from jealousy, one's learning from the effects of vanity, and one's self from negligence.
ānṛṣaṁsyaṁ paro dharmaḥ kṣamā ca paramaṁ balam | ātmajñānaṁ paraṁ jñānaṁ paraṁ satya vrata vratam || 27 ||
Compassion is the supreme Dharma, and forgiveness is strongest spiritual force, the knowledge of the Self is the best of all learning, and truthfulness is the best of all religious vows.
satyasya vacanaṁ śreyaḥ satyaṁ jñānaṁ hitaṁ bhavet | yad būta-hitam atyantaṁ tad vai satyaṁ paraṁ matam || 28 ||
The telling of truth is good, and the knowledge of truth may also be good, but that which conduces to the greatest good of all beings, is known as the highest truth.

karmaṇaiva hi saṃsiddhim āsthitā janakādayaḥ | loka saṅgraham-evāpi saṃpaśyan kartum arhasi ||
Verily, by Karma Yoga alone did Janaka and others reach perfection. Indeed, you should act, bearing in mind the welfare of the world. Gītā 3:20
saṃniyam endriya-grāmaṃ sarvatra sama-buddhayaḥ | te prāpnuvanti mām-eva sarva-bhūta-hite-ratāḥ ||
Having subdued all their senses, unprejudiced, intent on the welfare of all beings — they too come to Me alone. Gītā 12:4
yas sarve samārambhā nirāśīr bandhanāḥ sadā | tyāge yasya hutaṁ sarvaṁ sa tyāgī sa ca buddhimān || 29 ||
One whose actions are performed without the object of securing any personal reward, who has sacrificed all into the fire of renunciation, is a real Sannyāsin and is really wise.
yato na gurutāṁ cainaṁ śrāvayed upapādayan | taṁ vidyād brāhmaṇo yogam ayogaṁ yoga saṁjñitam || 30 ||
Therefore one should decrease one's attachment to the physical world. This non-attachment (ayoga) is called unification (yoga). This knowledge of unification with the Supreme consciousness should not be taught to unsuitable aspirants.

This teaching you should never reveal to one who is devoid of self-discipline and devotion, nor to one who has no desire to listen, nor certainly to one who traduces Me. Gītā 18:67
We must not harm any living creature, and we must live on terms of friendliness with all, and in this hard to obtain human birth20, we must not allow enmity to develop with anyone.
ākiñcanyaṁ susaṅtoṣo nirāśitvam acāpalam | etad eva paraṁ jñānaṁ sadātmajñānam uttamam || 32 ||
Not depending on any other, cultivating tranquility in all situations, renunciation of hope and inconsiderate conduct — these are the ways by which spiritual insight can always be secured; and the knowledge of the Self (one's own spiritual nature) is the best of all knowledge.
Commentary.
Not depending on any other (ākiñcanyam) has a twofold reference. (a) Self-effort – making the effort to improve oneself by one's own effort.
uddhared-ātman-ātmānaṃ nātmānam avasādayet | ātmaiva hy-ātmano bandhur-ātmaiva ripur-ātmanaḥ ||
One should raise one’s Self by one’s own mind and not allow one’s Self to sink; for the mind alone is the friend of the Self, and the mind alone is the adversary of the Self. Gītā 6:5
Rāmānuja comments:— By the Self (ātman), that is, by the mind which is unattached to sense-objects, one should raise one’s self. One should not allow one’s mind which is inclined to sense gratification to drag one down. Friends and enemies exist in the mind alone.
(b) Relying on the Lord — surrendering the burden of Liberation.
sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṃ śaraṇaṃ vraja | ahaṃ tvā sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ ||
"Completely relinquishing all Dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. I will release you from the effect of all sins, grieve not." Gītā 18:66
parigrahaṁ parityajya bhaved buddhyā yata-vrataḥ | aśokaṁ sthānam āśritya niścalaṁ pretya ceha ca || 33 ||
Renouncing all worldly desires and assuming a stoic indifference [to the pairs of opposites], people practice self-control with the aid of their intelligence — thereby all suffering ceases in this world as well as hereafter.
tapo nityena dāntena muninā saṁyatātmanā | ajitaṁ jetu kāmena bhāvyaṁ saṅgeśvasaṅginā || 34 ||
The muni who desires to obtain moksha (Liberation), which is very difficult to attain, must be constant in austerities, forbearing, self-restrained, and must give up that craving and attachment which binds him to the things of this earth.
guṇāguṇa manāsaṅgam ekakāryam anantaram | etat tad brahmaṇo vṛttam āhur eka padaṁ sukham || 35 ||
One who has transcended the guṇas while embodied, and lives without attachment who is guided by the antaryāmi (the higher self) alone, who is free from nescience and has realised the Truth abides in true joy.
sama duḥkha sukhaḥ svasthaḥ sama loṣṭāśma kāñcanaḥ | tulya priyāpriyo dhīras-tulya nindātma saṃstutiḥ || 24 ||

42
mānāpamānayos tulyas tulyo mitrāri pakṣayoḥ | sarvārambha parityāgī guṇātītaḥ sa ucyate || 25 ||
One who is poised in pleasure and pain, who focuses within, to whom a clod, a stone and piece of gold are of equal value, who remains the same towards the pleasant and the unpleasant and who is intelligent, and regards both censure and praise of himself as equal; one who is the same in honour and dishonour, and the same to friend and foe, and who has abandoned all enterprises — such a person is said to have transcended the Gunas. Gītā 14: 24, 25
parityajati yo duḥkhaṁ sukhaṁ cāpyubhayaṁ naraḥ | brahma prāpnoti sotyantamāsaṅgaṁ ca na gacchati || 36 ||
By renouncing the objects of both pleasure and pain and by abandoning emotional attachment to material things, one may attain Brahman (Supreme Being or Liberation).

O good Brahmin, I have now briefly explained to you all this, as I myself have heard it. Now what else do you wish to know?"

t
brāhmaṇa uvāca nyāya yuktam idaṁ sarvaṁ bhavatā parikīrtitam | na te'styaviditaṁ kiñcid dharmeṣviha hi dṛśyate || 1 ||
The Brahmin said:– "All this that you have explained, is rational, and it seems to me that there is nothing in connection with the mysteries of Dharma which you do not know."
vyādha uvāca pratyakṣaṁ mama yo dharmastaṁ ca paśya dvijottama | yena siddhir iyaṁ prāptā mayā brāhmaṇa puṅgava || 2 ||
The butcher replied:– "O great Brahmin, I shall reveal to you directly, all the virtue that I lay claim to, and by reason of which I have attained this blissful state.
uttiṣṭha bhagavan kṣipraṁ praviśyābhyantaraṁ gṛham | draṣṭum arhasi dharmajña mātaraṁ pitaraṁ ca me || 3 ||
Rise, venerable sir, and quickly enter this inner apartment. I would like to introduce you to my father and my mother."

Markandeya continued:– "Thus addressed, the Brahmin followed him in, and beheld a fine beautiful mansion. It was a magnificent house divided in four suites of rooms.
devatā gṛha saṁkāśa daivataiśca supūjitam | śayanāsana saṁbādhaṁ gandhaiśca paramair yutam || 5 ||
It was admired by gods and looked like one of their palaces; it was also furnished with seats and beds, and redolent of excellent perfumes.
tatra śuklāmbaradharau pitarāvasya pūjitau | kṛtāhārau tu saṁtuṣṭāv upaviṣṭau varāsane || 6 ||
He regularly revered both his parents who were clad in white robes. Having finished their meals, they were seated contentedly at ease.
tasya vyādhasya pitarau brāhmaṇaḥ saṁdadarśa ha | dharmavyādhastu tau dṛṣṭvā pādeśu śirasā'patat || 7 ||
The butcher, Dharmavyādha on seeing them, prostrated himself before them on the ground with his head touching their feet.

His aged parents then addressed him thus:– "Arise, O pious man, arise, may Dharma protect you; we are much pleased with you; may you be blessed with a long life, and with knowledge, high intelligence, and ultimate liberation.
sat putreṇa tvayā putra nityaṁ kāle supūjitau | sukham eva vasāvo'tra deva loka gatāviva || 9 ||
You are a good and dutiful son, for, we are constantly and reasonably looked after by you, we are living very happily in this house – it's as if we had reached the heaven of Indra.
na te'nyad daivataṁ kiñcid daivateśvapi vartate | prayatatvād dvijātīnāṁ damenāsi samānavitaḥ || 10 ||
You have never worshipped any other divinity amongst the celestials. You regard us alone as your deities21. By constantly subduing yourself, you have become endowed with the self- restraining power of Brahmins.
pituḥ pitāmahā ye ca tathaiva prapitāmahāḥ | prītāste satataṁ putra damenāvāṁ ca pūjayā || 11 ||
All your grandfathers, great grandfathers and ancestors are constantly pleased with you for your self-restraining virtues and for your piety towards us.
manasā karmaṇā vācā śuśrūśā naiva hīyate | na cānyā hi tathā buddhirdṛṣyate sāṁprataṁ tava || 12 ||
In thought, word or deed your attention to us never fails, and it seems that at present you have no other thought in your mind [save as to how to please us].
jāmadagnyena rāmeṇa yathā vṛddhau supūjitau | tathā tvayā kṛtaṁ sarvaṁ tad viśiṣṭaṁ ca putraka || 13 ||
Just as [Parashu]-Rama, the son of Jamadagni, worked hard to please his aged parents, so have you, O Son, done to please us, and even so much more.
mārkaṇḍeya uvāca tatas taṁ brāhmaṇaṁ tābhyāṁ dharmavyādho nyavedayat | tau svāgatena taṁ vipram arcayāmāsa tus tadā || 14 ||
21 mātru devo bhava pitru devo bhava — Let your mother be your deity, let your father be your deity (Taittiriya Upaṇiṣad)

Then the butcher introduced the Brahmin to his parents and they received him with the usual salutation of welcome with great respect.
pratipūjya tāṁ pūjāṁ dvijaḥ papraccha tāvubhau | saputrābhyāṁ sabhṛtyābhyāṁ kaccid vāṁ kuśalaṁ gṛhe | anāmayam ca vāṁ kaccit sadaiveha śarīrayoḥ || 15 ||
The Brahmin accepting their worship with gratitude, enquired if they, with their children and servants, were all well, and if they were always enjoying good health at that time (of life).
vṛddhāvūcatuḥ kuśalaṁ nau gṛhe vipra bhṛtyavarge ca sarvaśaḥ | kaccit tvam apyavighnena saṁprāpto bhagavanniti || 16 ||
The aged couple replied:– "At home, O priest, we are all very well, along with all our servants. Have you, adorable sir, arrived here without any difficulty?"
mārkaṇḍeya uvāca bāḍham ityeva tau vipraḥ pratyuvāca mudānvitaḥ | dharmavyādho nirīkṣyātha tatas taṁ vākyam abravīt || 17 ||
Markandeya continued:– The Brahmin answered in the affirmative. Then the butcher addressing himself to the Brahmin said to him:–
vyādha uvāca pitā mātā ca bhagavann etau me daivataṁ param | yad daivatebhyaḥ kartavyaṁ tad etābhyāṁ karomyaham || 18 ||
"These my parents, venerable sir, are the deities that I worship; whatever offerings are due to the gods, I offer unto them.
trayastriṁśad yathā devāḥ sarve śakra purogamāḥ | saṁpūjyāḥ sarv alokasya tathā vṛddhāvimau mama || 19 ||
As the thirty-three gods22 with Indra at their head are worshipped by devotees, so are these aged parents of mine worshipped by me.
upāhārānāharanto devatānāṁ yathā dvijaḥ | kurvanti tad vad etābhyāṁ karomy-aham atandritaḥ || 20 ||
As Brahmins exert themselves for the purpose of procuring offerings for their gods, so do I act with diligence for these two (deities of mine).
etau me paramaṁ brahman pitā mātā ca daivatam | etau puṣpaiḥ phalair annais toṣayāmi sadā dvija || 21 ||
These my father and mother, O Brahmin, are my supreme deities, and I seek to please them always with offerings of flowers, fruits and food.
etāv evāgnayo mahyaṁ yān vadanti manīśiṇaḥ | yajñā vedāśca catvāraḥ sarvam etau mama dvija || 22 ||
22 There are 33 devas who help the Supreme Lord to rule the universe. According to Vedic Tradition only these thirty-three gods may receive offerings. Although there are many other inhabitants of heaven who deserve praise and veneration, they do not have the full status of gods and therefore may not be offered sacrifices. The Thirty Three Gods are comprised of Prajapati, Indra, 8 Vasus, 12 Adityas, and 11 Rudras.
44

To me they are like the three sacred fires mentioned by the learned; and they are to me as good as yajñas and the four Vedas.
etad arthaṁ mama prāṇā bhāryā putraḥ suhṛjjanaḥ | saputradāraḥ śuśrūśāṁ nityam eva karomyaham || 23 ||
My very life-force, my wife and children and friends are all for them [dedicated to their service]. And along with my wife and children I always attend on them.
svayaṁ ca snāpayāmy etau tathā pādau pradhāvaye | āhāraṁ ca prayacchāmi svayañca dvijasattama || 24 ||
O good Brahmin, with my own hands I assist them in bathing and also wash their feet and I myself serve them their meals.
anukūlāḥ kathā vacmi vipriyaṁ parivarjaye | adharmeṇāpi saṁyuktaṁ priyamābhyāṁ karomyaham || 25 ||
I say to them only what is agreeable, leaving out what is unpleasant. I consider it to be my highest duty to do what is agreeable to them even though it be not strictly justifiable.
pañcaiva guravo brahman puruṣasya bubhūṣataḥ | pitā mātā'gnirātmā ca guruśca dvijasattama || 26 ||
There are five gurus, O Brahmin that are worthy of the highest reverence from a person who seeks progress; the two parents, the sacred fire, the Self and the spiritual preceptor.
eteṣu yas tu varteta samyag eva dvijottama | bhaveyur aprayastena paricīrṇāstu nityaśaḥ | gārhasthye vartamānasya eṣa dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ || 27 ||
By serving them with due dilligence, one acquires the merit of perpetually keeping up the sacred gārhapatya fire23. And it is the eternal and invariable duty of all householders."
|| śrīḥ || adhyāyaḥ 10

The service of my parents is my spiritual practice (tapasya). Notice the power of this practice of mine, by which I have achieved clairvoyance. This is the reason why I know that you were told by that self-restrained, truthful lady, devoted to her husband, that you should come to Mithila to meet me so that I could explain to you, the mysteries of Dharma.

23 Gārhapatya fire is the fire of the home hearth that is established at the time of marriage in the canopy and is brought home. It is kept perpetually burning and oblations are made every morning and evening.
45

The Brahmin said:– "O pious one, so constant in fulfilling you religious obligations, reflecting on what that truthful good-natured lady said, I am convinced that you are truly endowed with every exceptional quality.
vyādha uvāca tvad anugraha buddhyā tu vipraitad darśitaṁ mayā | vākyaṁ ca śṛṇu me tāta yatte vakṣye hitaṁ dvija || 4 ||
Out of compassion I have explained all this to you. And now, good sir, listen to me as I explain what I think is beneficial for you.
tvayā na pūjitā mātā pitā ca dvijasattama | anisṛṣṭo'si niṣkrānto gṛhāt tābhyām aninadita || 5 ||
O good Brahmin, you have done the wrong thing by your parents, for you left home without their permission, for the purpose of studying the Vedas.
vedoccāraṇa kāryārtham ayuktaṁ tat tvayā kṛtam | tava śokena vṛddhau tāv-andhībhūtau tapasvinau || 6 ||
You have not acted properly in this matter, for your ascetic and aged parents have become entirely blind from grief at your absence.
tau prasādayituṁ gaccha mā tvāṁ dharmo'tyagād ayam | tapasvī tvaṁ mahātmā ca dharme ca nirataḥ sadā || 7 ||
Please return home to console them. May you never abandon this supreme duty. You are noble-minded, have ascetic merit, and are completely devoted to your Dharma.

But all these virtues are wasted by not pleasing your parents. So go quickly without delay Brahmin and console them. Pay attention to what I am saying to you in sincerity. I tell you what is good for you, O Brahmin, return home this very day."
brāhmaṇa uvāca yad etad uktaṁ bhavatā sarvaṁ satyam asaṁśayam | prīto'smi tava bhadraṁ te dharmācāra guṇānvita || 9 ||
The Brahmin replied:– "All that you have said is undoubtedly true; I am extremely happy with you and I wish you all the best."

By a stroke of singular good luck have I arrived here, and by a similar stroke of good luck have I come in contact with you. It is extremely rare to discover, in our midst, a person who can so well expound the mysteries of Dharma; there is scarcely one among thousands, who is so well versed in the science of Dharma.
mātāpitṛbhyāṁ śuśrūśāṁ kariṣye vacanāt tava | nākṛtātmā vedayati dharmādharma viniścayam || 12 ||
46
Acting on your advice, I shall return home and take care of my father and my mother; for one with an impure heart could never expound the mysteries of merit and demerit [as you have done].
durjñeyaḥ śāśvato dharmaḥ śūdra-yonau hi vartatā | na tvāṁ śūdram ahaṁ manye bhavitavyaṁ hi kāraṇam || 13 ||
As it is very difficult for a person born as a Sudra to learn the profound mysteries of the eternal Dharma, I definitely do not consider you to be a Sudra. There must surely be some mystery in connection with this matter.
yena karma viśeṣeṇa prāpteyaṁ śūdratā tvayā | etām iccāmi vijñātuṁ tattvena tava śūdratām | kāmayānas me śaṁsa sarvaṁ tvaṁ prayatātmavān || 14 ||
You must have attained the Sudra's estate by reason of the fruition of yours own past karma. O magnanimous one, I long to know the truth about this matter. Please reveal this mystery if you don't mind."

The butcher replied:– "I was in my former life a Brahmin, well-read in the Vedas, and an accomplished student of all the Vedangas24. Through my own fault I have been degraded to my present state as a butcher.

A certain king, accomplished in the science of dhanur-veda (science of archery), was my friend; and from his companionship, O Brahmin, I, too became skilled in archery. Then one day the king and I, in company with his ministers and the best warriors, went out on a hunting expedition. They killed many animals near an ashram of a certain rishi named Subāhu.
atha kṣiptaḥ śaro ghoro mayāpi dvijasattama | tāḍitaśca ṛṣistana śareṇā nataparvaṇā || 18 ||
Afterwards I too shot a very powerfull arrow, but my aim was faulty and the rishi was wounded thereby.
bhūmau nipatito brahman uvāca pratinādayan | nāparādhyāmy ahaṁ kiñcit kena pāpam idaṁ kṛtam || 19 ||
He fell down upon the ground, and screaming loudly said, "I have harmed no one, what wicked man has done this to me?"
manvānas taṁ mṛgaṁ cāhaṁ saṁprāptaḥ sahasā munim | apaśyaṁ tam ṛṣiṁ viddhaṁ śareṇā nataparvaṇā || 20 ||
24 The six Vedaṅgas or 'Limbs of the Vedas' are:— 1. Śikṣā – Phonetics, 4. Nirukta – Etymology of words, 2. Chandas – Prosody, 5. Jyotiṣa – Astronomy/Astrology, 3. Vyākaraṇa – Grammar, 6. Kalpa – Ritual treatises.
47

And, my lord, I had mistakenly assumed that he was a deer, I went up to him and found that he was pierced through the body by my arrow.
akārya karaṇāccāpi bhṛśaṁ me vyathitaṁ manaḥ | tam ugra tapasaṁ vipraṁ niṣṭanantaṁ mahītale || 21 ||
This avoidable crime should never have been committed and I was consumed with remorse. That highly spiritually advanced sage was writhing on the ground in agony.
ajānatā kṛtam idaṁ mayety ahamathābruvam | kṣantum arhasi me sarva miti cokto mayā muniḥ || 22 ||
I immediately begged his pardon, "O revered sir, I have committed this crime unwittingly, I beg your forgiveness. If you think it proper, pardon me this transgression."
tataḥ pratyabravīd vākyam ṛṣir māṁ krodha mūrcchitaḥ | vyādhas tvaṁ bhavitā krūra śūdra yonāviti dvija || 23 ||
But, hearing my apologies, the rishi, whipping himself into a rage, cursed me saying:– "You will be born as a cruel butcher is the Sudra caste [beacause of what you have done!]"

The butcher continued:– "Thus cursed by that rishi, I tried to propitiate him by saying:– O venerable sir please protect me! Pardon me, O muni, today I have committed this wicked crime unwittingly. I beg you to forgive me, please be compassionate to me." The rishi was somewhat pacified.
ṛṣir uvāca nānyathā bhavitā śāpa evam etad asaṁśayam |
ānṛṣaṁsyāt tvahaṁ kiñcit kartā'nugraham adya te || 26 ||
The rishi replied:– "The curse that I have pronounced can never be invalidated, this is certain. But from compassion towards you, I shall do you a favour.
śūdrayonyāṁ vartamāno dharmajño hi bhaviśyasi | mātāpitroś śuśrūṣāṁ kariṣyasi na saṁśayaḥ || 27 ||
Though born as a Sudra you shall nevertheless remain fully cognisant of Dharma and you shall undoubtedly serve your parents.
tayoḥ śuśrūṣayā siddhiṁ mahatīṁ samavāpsyasi | jātismaraś bhavitā svargaṁ caiva gamiṣyasi || 28 ||
And by your devoted service to them you shall attain great spiritual perfection. You shall also have free recollection of your past lives and shalt go to the heavenly realms [after death].
śāpakṣaye tu nirvṛtte bhavitā'si punar dvijaḥ | prasādaśca kṛtastena mamaiva dvipadāṁvara || 29 ||
On the expiation of this curse, you shall again become a Brahmin". O best of men, thus, in ancient times I was cursed by that rishi of severe power, and also received his blessing.
śaraṁ coddhṛtavān asmi tasya vai dvijasattama | āśramaṁ ca mayā nīto na ca prāṇair vyayujyata || 30 ||

Then, I extricated the arrow from his body, and carried him into the hermitage, but he was not fately wounded and in due time recovered.
brāhmaṇa uvāca duṣkaraṁ hi kṛtaṁ karma jānatā jātim ātmanaḥ | loka vṛttānta tattvajña nityaṁ dharma parāyaṇa || 31 ||
The Brahmin said:– "In accordance with the conventions of your tribe you have have followed this odious profession, but you are always devoted to Dharma and well versed in the ways and mysteries of the world.
sāṁprataṁ ca mato me'si brāhmaṇo nātra saṁśayaḥ | brāhmaṇaḥ patanīyeṣu vartamāno vikarmasu | dāmbhiko duṣkṛtaḥ prāyaḥ śūdreṇa sadṛṣo bhavet || 32 ||
But even now itself, I consider you to be a Brahmin, there is no doubt about this. For the Brahmin who is vain and haughty, who is addicted to vices and dishonourable and degrading practices, is like a Sudra.
yas tu śūdro dame satye dharme ca satatotthitaḥ | taṁ brāhmaṇam ahaṁ manye vṛttena hi bhaved dvijaḥ || 33 ||
On the other hand, I consider a Sudra who is always adorned with these virtues — rectitude, self-restraint and truthfulness — as a Brahmin.
Commentary
yasya yallakṣaṇā proktā pūso varṇābhi vyañjakam |
yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta tat tenaiva vinirdiśet || If the qualities pertaining to a certain caste are seen in another caste, then the later are to be classified as belonging to the former. (Bhagavatam Sk. 7; Adhy. 11; 35.)
karmabhiḥ śucibhir devī śuddhātmā vijitendriyaḥ |
śūdro-pi dvijavat sevya iti brahmābravīt svayam || Even a sudra O Devi that has purified himself by good deeds and has subjugated his senses should be served like a twice-born person, this has been declared by Brahma himself. (Anusasana Parva 143:48)
karmadoṣeṇa viśamāṁ gatimāpnoii dāruṇām | kṣīṇadoṣam ahaṁ manye cābhitastvāṁ narottama || 35 ||
It is due to one's negative Karma alone that one is born in disagreeable circumstances but I believe that the negative Karma in you has now been depleted."
vyādha uvāca prajñayā mānasaṁ duḥkhaṁ hanyāccārīramauṣadhaiḥ | etad vijñāna sāmarthyaṁ na bālais samatāmiyāt || 36 ||
The butcher replied:– "The ailments of the body should be cured with medicines, and the mental ones with spiritual knowledge. This is the power of knowledge.
aniṣṭa saṁprayogāccha viprayogāt prayisya ca | manuṣyā mānasair duḥkhair yujyante cālpa buddhayaḥ || 37 ||
Ignorant people are overpowered with grief at the experience of something which is disagreeable to them, or separation/deprivation from something which is good or much desired.

guṇairbhūtāni yujyante viyujyante tathaiva ca | sarvāṇi naitadekasya śokasthānaṁ hi vidyate || 38 ||
The three gunas function according to their natures causing conjunction and disjunction. Indeed, all creatures are subject to grief and joy. It is not merely a single creature or class of existence that is subject to misery.
aniṣṭanānvitaṁ paśyaṁs tathā kṣipraṁ virajyate | tataśca pratikurvanti yadi paśyanty upakramam || 39 ||
When creatures encounter anything disagreeable they quickly resile, and if at the commencement of a project they anticipate problems then they will take means to prevent it happening.
śocato na bhavet kiñcit kevalaṁ paritapyate | parityajanti ye duḥkhaṁ sukhaṁ vā'pyubhayaṁ narāḥ || 40 ||
Simply grieving over a loss is unproductive. Remorse can be productive [of change]. Those wise people who are indifferent to both happiness (gain) and misery (loss), are really content.
ta eva sukham edhante jñāna-tṛptā manīśiṇaḥ | asaṅtośaparā mūḍhāḥ saṅtoṣaṁ yānti paṇḍitāḥ || 41 ||
The wise that are very insightful are always contented and the foolish always discontented and attached to their state. The wise purposefully pursue contentment.
asaṅtośasya nāsty antas tuṣṭistu paramaṁ sukham | na śocanti gatādhvānaḥ paśyantaḥ paramāṁ gatiṁ || 42 ||
There is no end to discontentment, and contentment is the highest achievement. People who have reached the perfect way, do not grieve, they are always mindful of the highest goal.
na viṣāde manaḥ kāryaṁ viṣādo viṣam-uttamam | mārayatya kṛta prajñaṁ bālaṁ kruddha ivoragaḥ || 43 ||
One must not give way to discontent25 for it is like a virulent poison. It kills those lacking insight, just as child is killed by an enraged snake.
avaśyaṁ kriyamāṇas karmaṇo dṛṣyate phalam | na hi nirvedam āgamya kiñcit prāpnoti śobhanam || 44 ||
Our actions are surely followed by their consequences. Whoever merely gives way to dispair [for worldly affairs] can never accomplish any good.
athāpyupāyaṁ paśyeta duḥkhas parimokṣaṇe | aśocan nārabhetaivaṁ muktaścāvyasanī bhavet || 45 ||
One should strive to be liberated from suffering. Instead of dispair and grumbling one must become proactive and find the way to freedom from suffering.
bhūteśvabhāvaṁ sañcintya ye tu buddheḥ paraṁ gatāḥ | na śocanti kṛta prajñāḥ paśyantaḥ paramāṁ gatim || 46 ||
Everything in samsara is instable and impermanent. Once this is truly realised one will attain the highest state of wisdom — freedom from suffering and unification with the Divine.
25 Vishada is the original. It means discontent, but here it means more a mixture of discontent, perplexity and confusion than mere discontent.

na śocāmi ca vai vidvan kālākāṅkṣī sthitosmyaham | etair nidarśanair brahman nāvasīdāmi sattama || 47 ||
I too, O learned man, do not give way to grief; I stay here [in this life] biding my time. For all these afore mentioned reasons I experience no grief or lack of motivation."
brāhmaṇa uvāca āpṛcche tvāṁ svasti te'stu dharmas tvāṁ parirakṣatu | apramādas tu kartavyo dharme dharmabhṛtāṁvara || 48 ||
The Brahmin said;— "I now request your permission to depart, O best of the upholders of Dharma, may you be prosperous, and may Dharma protect you, and may you continue to be assiduous in the practice of Dharma."
mārkaṇḍeya uvāca bāḍham ityeva taṁ vyādhaḥ kṛtāñjalir uvāca ha | pradakṣiṇam atho kṛtvā prasthito dvijasattamaḥ || 49 ||
Markandeya continued:– The butcher said to him, "So be it". And the good Brahmin walked round him26 and then departed.
sa tu gatvā dvijaḥ sarvāṁ śuśrūṣāṁ kṛtavāṁs tadā | mātāpitṛbhyām andhābhyāṁ yathānyāyaṁ suśaṁsitaḥ || 50 ||
The Brahmin returning home began to diligently serve his old parents who were both blind. Being overjoyed they praised him enthusiastically.
etat te sarvam ākhyātaṁ nikhilena yudhiṣṭhira | pṛṣṭavānasi yaṁ tāta dharmaṁ dharma-bhṛtāṁvara || 51 ||
I have thus, O good Yudhishthira, narrated to you in great detail, this anecdote full of moral instruction, which you, my good son, asked me about.
yudhiṣṭhira uvāca atyadbhutam idaṁ brahman dharmākhyānam anuttamam | sarva dharma vidāṁ śreṣṭha kathitaṁ munisattama || 51 ||
Yudhishthira replied:– "O most venerable Mārkaṇḍeya and best of munis, you have indeed related to me this most amazing and unique narrative.
sukhaśrāvyatayā vidvan muhūrta iva me gataḥ | na hi tṛptosmi bhagavañ śṛṇvāno dharmam uttamam || 52 ||
O learned one, listening to this story with wrapt attention, time has passed in an instant; but, O adorable sir, I am not as yet satiated with hearing you discourse on Dharma."
