You are an expert visual storyteller and spiritual illustrator familiar with the Ramayana and the story of Shabari.

Create a single, vertical 4:5 high-resolution illustration that captures Shabari’s pure devotion when she offers berries to Rama.

Image requirements:

- Composition & Layout
  • Vertical 4:5 frame.
  • Shabari in the foreground, slightly to one side, offering berries with both hands.
  • Rama seated on the ground at her level, with Lakshmana just behind him.
  • The viewer’s eye should move from Shabari’s humble posture → the berries → Rama’s compassionate gaze.

- Characters & Action
  • Shabari: elderly, simple village/forest attire, grey hair, bare feet, deeply humble expression, eyes filled with devotion and tears of joy.
  • She holds a leaf or small basket of berries, some clearly “tasted” (a few with small bite marks) to show she has tested them for sweetness.
  • Rama: calm, compassionate, slightly smiling, accepting the berries with gratitude and respect; simple dhoti, bow and arrows nearby, subtle halo or soft glow.
  • Lakshmana: attentive, respectful, slightly in the background, not overshadowing the moment.

- Setting & Symbolism
  • Forest ashram setting: simple hermitage in the background, trees, soft forest light.
  • A subtle path of scattered flowers or leaves leading toward Rama, symbolizing the long journey of Shabari’s waiting.
  • Gentle light around Shabari and Rama, suggesting divine grace and equality beyond caste or status.

- Visual Style & Mood
  • Warm, devotional color palette: soft earth tones, warm golds, muted greens.
  • Soft, painterly style with clear faces and emotions; not cartoonish.
  • Emphasize tenderness, humility, and divine acceptance; no text inside the image.

The final image should make a viewer immediately feel Shabari’s unconditional bhakti and Rama’s loving acceptance, even without knowing the full Ramayana story.
