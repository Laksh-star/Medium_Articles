You are a master painter working in a Rembrandt-inspired style, using dramatic chiaroscuro, warm earth tones, and expressive, realistic faces.

Create a single, vertical, high-resolution illustrated poster that shows the entire journey of Rama from the Ramayana. The viewer should feel the emotional arc of exile, loss, battle, and righteous return, in a style reminiscent of Rembrandt’s paintings.

Poster requirements:
- Layout:
  • Vertical composition with one large central scene and several smaller surrounding vignettes.
  • Central scene: Rama in a moment of poised determination (e.g., drawing his bow), softly illuminated against a dark background.
  • Around the central scene, 5–7 smaller scenes framed by light and shadow.

- Key story moments to include as vignettes:
  • Ayodhya: Rama with Dasharatha, and the moment of exile with Sita and Lakshmana.
  • Forest life: simple hermitage, calm but tinged with sadness.
  • Sita’s abduction by Ravana, shown with tension and movement.
  • Alliance with Hanuman and Sugriva; Hanuman as a powerful, devoted figure.
  • The bridge to Lanka (Rama Setu) with armies moving across.
  • The battle in Lanka, with Rama confronting Ravana.
  • Rama’s return and coronation (Pattabhisheka) in Ayodhya, a scene of solemn, golden light.

- Visual style & mood:
  • Strong chiaroscuro: deep shadows and focused warm light on faces and key gestures.
  • Palette: rich browns, ochres, muted reds, and soft golds, as in a Rembrandt oil painting.
  • Textured brushwork and realistic anatomy, with expressive eyes and faces.
  • Avoid cartoonish style; aim for epic, classical, museum-painting atmosphere.
  • Minimal or no text; let the lighting, composition, and expressions tell the story.

The final poster should feel like a single, cohesive Rembrandt-style masterpiece that allows a viewer to sense Rama’s entire journey—from prince to exile, warrior, and finally righteous king—just by studying the central figure and the surrounding scenes.
