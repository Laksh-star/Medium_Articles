            "Team Leader: All right, Carl, we need to discuss the dirt situation. The tunnel's progress is good, but every shovel full of soil adds another problem. What’s your take on our options?\n",
            "\n",
            "Carl (Person in Charge of Digging): I've been thinking about it, sir. We could try storing the dirt near the tunnel, maybe pile it up to cover the opening. But that risks drawing attention—if the guards notice an unusual mound, it could lead them right to us.\n",
            "\n",
            "Team Leader: True. We could also consider hauling it out bit by bit, but that gives us too many trips and increases the chance of detection. And then there’s the idea of pushing it further down the hill. Still, that might require extra work and could be discovered when someone notices disturbed earth.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carl: Exactly. My worry is that if we create a dedicated disposal area, it might become known. We need something more integrated into the environment. I was also considering whether we could use the dirt to reinforce weak spots in the tunnel. But that wouldn’t clear the space sufficiently, and it could risk our progress if the tunnel collapses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Team Leader: I've been looking at the terrain as well, and then it struck me—why not dispose of the soil in the river? We could quietly funnel it into the water during the late hours when watch is minimal. The river’s current would carry it away, and the natural murk would hide anything that might look out of place.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carl: The river? That might just work. The water’s constant motion would dilute any suspicious buildup. We could also use the natural sounds to mask any scraping or shifting noises from diverting the dirt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Team Leader: Precisely. We’d need to plan the diversion carefully. Clear a path from the tunnel to a less monitored section of the riverbank, and then work during the darkest hours. While it will demand extra coordination, it’s the least conspicuous solution we have.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carl: It does sound like our best option, sir. I’ll reposition the crew and start mapping out a discreet route along the camp’s edge to the river. We’ll have to minimize our footprint, but I believe it’s manageable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Team Leader: Excellent. Keep the team motivated and vigilant. Every load of dirt safely deposited in the river brings us one step closer to freedom. Let’s get to work, Carl.\n",
            "\n",
            "Carl: Understood, sir. I’ll brief the crew and set things in motion right away.\n",
