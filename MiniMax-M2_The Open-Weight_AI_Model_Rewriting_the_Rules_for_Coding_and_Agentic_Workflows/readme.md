# MiniMax-M2 Real-Time Research Agent Demo

One-click Google Colab demo that turns **MiniMax-M2** (via OpenRouter) into a fully autonomous research agent — no GPU, no paid search APIs, no function-calling scaffolding required.

### What it does in <5 minutes
1. You give M2 a high-level research goal  
2. M2 autonomously creates a step-by-step plan  
3. M2 writes perfect search queries  
4. The notebook runs real web searches (DuckDuckGo, zero API key)  
5. M2 synthesizes fresh results into a professional summary  
6. M2 writes and executes a beautiful comparison chart (usually works first try)

### How to run
1. Open → https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourname/MiniMax-M2_Agentic_Research_Demo.ipynb  
2. Get a free OpenRouter API key → https://openrouter.ai/keys  
3. Paste the key into Cell 1  
4. Run all cells (Shift+Enter)

Change the research topic in Cell 2 to anything you want — the same six cells still work.

As of November 2025, this is the simplest, most impressive live demonstration of open-weight agentic capability available.

Model used: `minimax/minimax-m2` (230B MoE, 204K context, currently #1 open-source on τ-Bench, SWE-Bench Verified, ToolBench, etc.)

Enjoy watching the model plan, search, reason, and code — all by itself.
