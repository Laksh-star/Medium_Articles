# Background

Leo Tolstoy was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist, playwright and philosopher who primarily wrote novels and short stories [1]. Tolstoy was born into an aristocratic family in 1828 [1]. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852â€“1856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War [1]. His fiction includes dozens of short stories such as "After the Ball" (1911), and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859) and Hadji Murad (1912) [1]. He also wrote plays and philosophical essays [1].
In the 1870s, Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession (1882) [2][1]. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist [1]. Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr [1].
Tolstoy is widely regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time [1]. He has been praised by other literary giants such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anton Chekhov, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Thomas Mann and Vladimir Nabokov [1].

# Writing Style and Themes

Tolstoy's short stories are renowned for their profound exploration of human nature and the human condition. His writing style is characterized by its simplicity, universality, and accessibility, as he believed that art should be easily understandable to all [2][3]. Tolstoy's stories often revolve around religious and moral themes, as he sought to convey the importance of seeking the kingdom of God on earth and living a life of humility and asceticism [2].
One of the most prominent themes in Tolstoy's short stories is the concept of altruism and benevolence towards the human race [4]. His stories often emphasize the importance of serving others and ensuring their happiness as "the pursuit of life" [5]. Tolstoy believed that mindful listening and attending to the needs of others could fortify relationships and provide its own rewards [5].
Another significant theme in Tolstoy's short stories is the search for meaning and purpose in life, particularly in the face of inevitable death [6]. Tolstoy grappled with the question of why one should live and what gives life meaning, exploring these ideas through his characters and their struggles [6].
Tolstoy's writing also often reflects the social hierarchy and patriarchal nature of Russian society in the late 19th century [7]. His stories depict the struggles of the peasantry and the dominance of men in the community, workplace, and government [7].

# Notable Short Stories

Leo Tolstoy wrote numerous short stories throughout his literary career, many of which are considered masterpieces of the form.

## "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" (1886)

Often regarded as one of the best examples of the novella, "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" explores themes of mortality, the meaning of life, and the search for spiritual awakening [8][1].

## "The Kreutzer Sonata" (1889)

In this controversial novella, Tolstoy presents a scathing critique of sexuality and marriage, reflecting his evolving views on morality and spirituality [2][1].

## "What Men Live By" (1885)

This story, a personal favorite of Tolstoy's, delves into the nature of love and the purpose of human existence [9][5].

## "Family Happiness" (1859)

An early work, "Family Happiness" examines the benefits and drawbacks of marriage, a theme Tolstoy would continue to explore throughout his career [2][1].

## "Hadji Murad" (1912)

Published posthumously, "Hadji Murad" is a novella that depicts the struggles of a Chechen rebel leader during the Caucasian War [1][10].

## "After the Ball" (1911)

This short story, written near the end of Tolstoy's life, showcases his enduring interest in social and moral issues [1][10].
These short stories, along with many others, demonstrate Tolstoy's mastery of the form and his ability to convey profound insights into the human condition [3][2][10].

# Tolstoy's Philosophical and Spiritual Journey

Despite his literary fame and success, Tolstoy found himself grappling with a profound existential crisis, questioning the meaning and purpose of his life [6]. He turned to science for answers but found that it circumvented the fundamental questions he was asking [6]. On the brink of suicide, Tolstoy made a final attempt to find light amidst the darkness by exploring the world's great religious and philosophical traditions [6].
Tolstoy's works are instinct with a literary beauty that gave artistic value even to his sermons, while his earlier novels show a deep concern for the welfare of society and a broad, humanitarian spirit [10]. His ego embraces the world, always placing himself at the center of his fictive creation, filling his books with his struggles, personae, problems, questions, and quests for answers [2]. Above all, Tolstoy's notion of life is an ethical search as strenuous as the pursuit of the Holy Grail [2].
In his autobiographical memoir, "A Confession," Tolstoy channeled the existential catastrophe of his inner life with extraordinary candor and emotional intensity [6]. He recognized that service to others and ensuring their happiness was "the pursuit of life" and provided its own rewards, considering it life's most noble calling [5]. Tolstoy's fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived [1], while his philosophical and spiritual journey shaped his subsequent pacifism and gave him material for realistic depictions of the horrors of war in his later work [1].

# Literary Techniques and Innovations

Tolstoy's short stories showcase his innovative literary techniques and his profound understanding of human nature. His works are characterized by a deep sympathy for the disinherited and a striking realism that would later be perfected by writers like Turgenev and Tolstoy himself [10]. Rather than puzzling or dazzling the reader, Tolstoy's stories invite exploration of a rich realm filled with his struggles, personae, problems, questions, and quests for answers [2].
In the second phase of his short fiction, following his spiritual crisis, Tolstoy's writing took a more moralistic turn. He began to view art as a "diabolic temptation" that diverted people from seeking the kingdom of God on earth [2]. In his monograph "What Is Art?", Tolstoy called for writing that was easily understandable, with religious subject matter, universal situations, simple style, and accessible technique [2]. "Master and Man" exemplifies these criteria, essentially serving as a morality play based on the New Testament [2].
Tolstoy's short stories also showcase his mastery of detail and his earnestness [1]. His seemingly guileless artistry worked "so much like nature," as noted by Thomas Mann [1]. Despite some criticism of his looseness of construction and "unreasonable and impracticable mysticism" by Arthur Conan Doyle [1], Tolstoy's short fiction remains a testament to his innovative techniques and profound insights into the human condition.

# Reception and Legacy

Tolstoy's short stories have been widely praised for their artistic merit and enduring relevance. Thomas Mann wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: "Seldom did art work so much like nature."[1] Vladimir Nabokov heaped superlatives upon "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" and "Anna Karenina", though he questioned the reputation of "War and Peace" and sharply criticized "Resurrection" and "The Kreutzer Sonata". However, Nabokov still called Tolstoy the "greatest Russian writer of prose fiction".[1] Critic Harold Bloom called "Hadji Murat" "my personal touchstone for the sublime in prose fiction, to me the best story in the world.
Tolstoy's short stories retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.[1] His experiences in battle during the Crimean War, recounted in his "Sevastopol Sketches", helped stir his subsequent pacifism and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.[1] His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.[1]
The second phase of Tolstoy's production of short fiction follows his two great novels and the tremendous spiritual crisis chronicled in "A Confession".[2] This was an extremely profound change for an author. The sublime artist comes to repudiate almost all art; the nobleman now lives like a peasant; the wealthy, titled country gentleman seeks to abandon his property, preaching humility and asceticism; the marvelous novelist and story writer prefers the roles of educational reformer, religious leader, social sage, cultural prophet.[2]
