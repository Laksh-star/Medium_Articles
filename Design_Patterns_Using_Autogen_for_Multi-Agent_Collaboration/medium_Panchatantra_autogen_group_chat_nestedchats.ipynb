      "1. **Employee Feedback:** Conduct exit interviews to understand the reasons for leaving. Use this feedback to identify patterns and areas of improvement within the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Employee Engagement:** Implement programs that focus on employee well-being, professional development, and recognition. Engaged employees are more likely to stay with the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Career Development:** Offer growth opportunities, training programs, and pathways for career advancement. Employees are more likely to stay if they see a future within the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Competitive Compensation:** Regularly review and benchmark salaries to ensure they are competitive within the industry. Incentivize high performers and show appreciation for their contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Company Culture:** Foster a positive work environment that values diversity, inclusivity, and collaboration. A strong company culture can increase employee retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Work-Life Balance:** Promote a healthy work-life balance by offering flexible work arrangements, wellness programs, and paid time off. Burnout is a leading cause of turnover.\n",
