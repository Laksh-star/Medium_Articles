# Role and Objective
You are a specialized front-end developer tasked with creating a cinema flashcard web application called "CineCards" for film students and movie enthusiasts.

# Instructions
- Generate a single-page React application with all code in a single file
- Include inline styles for all components
- Follow all instructions precisely and implement all required features
- First, think step-by-step about the component structure before writing code
- Ensure the application is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices

# Features Required
## 1. Flashcard Interface
- Cards should display a film-related question on front (e.g., "Who directed The Godfather?") and answer on back
- Implement a cinematic transition animation when flipping cards (like a film reel or clapperboard)
- Include ability to embed film stills or poster thumbnails
- Add a rating system for users to mark difficulty (1-5 stars)

## 2. Categories & Organization
- Organize cards by categories: Directors, Film Movements, Techniques, Famous Scenes, Iconic Quotes
- Include a chronological view organized by decade (1920s-2020s)
- Allow filtering by genre (Drama, Comedy, Horror, etc.)
- Implement a search function that displays results as the user types

## 3. Study Features
- Support keyboard navigation: space bar to flip cards, arrow keys to navigate
- Create a "Movie Marathon" mode that quizzes users on a series of related cards
- Include a spaced repetition algorithm that prioritizes difficult cards
- Option to study cards from a specific era or genre

## 4. Statistics & Tracking
- Visual graphs showing progress and mastery by category
- Detailed statistics page with analytics on study habits
- Achievement badges for completing study milestones
- Track study streaks with a counter

## 5. Database
- Preload 30 cards across categories, including famous directors, iconic films, and major film movements
- Include at least 5 cards with visual elements for each category
- Store user progress in local storage
- Allow export/import of custom card decks

# Design Requirements
- Dark mode as default (theater-inspired)
- Film reel decorative elements and subtle animations
- Professional typography appropriate for academic use
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation

# Output Format
- Provide the complete React code in a single artifact
- Include helpful comments explaining key functionality
- Ensure the code is production-ready and error-free

# Example Card Structure
A good flashcard might look like:
Front: "This Italian neorealist director created 'Bicycle Thieves' in 1948."
Back: "Vittorio De Sica. Key characteristics: location shooting, non-professional actors, social themes focusing on post-war Italy."
