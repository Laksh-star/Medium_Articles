You are an expert visual storyteller and spiritual illustrator familiar with the Ramayana, especially the episode where a small squirrel helps Rama’s army build the bridge to Lanka.

Create a single, vertical 4:5 high-resolution illustration that captures the moment when Rama lovingly acknowledges the squirrel’s contribution while the bridge to Lanka is being built.

Image requirements:

- Composition & Layout
  • Vertical 4:5 frame.
  • Foreground: Rama kneeling or sitting close to the ground, gently holding a small squirrel in his hands.
  • Midground: a few Vanaras (monkey warriors) carrying large stones to build the bridge.
  • Background: the partially built stone bridge stretching into the sea toward distant Lanka on the horizon.

- Characters & Action
  • Rama: calm, compassionate expression, simple dhoti, bow and arrows nearby, subtle halo or soft glow around his head. He holds the squirrel cupped in both hands, looking at it with affection and respect.
  • Squirrel: small, cute, with three faint stripes on its back. Show it with grains of sand on its fur, suggesting it has been rolling in sand and shaking it into the gaps between stones.
  • Vanaras: a few strong monkey warriors in the midground, some looking surprised or softened as they notice Rama honoring the tiny helper instead of only the big efforts.

- Setting & Symbolism
  • Location: seashore where the bridge is being built. Large stones and rocks arranged into a line leading into the ocean, waves gently hitting the sides.
  • The water should be calm but powerful, with soft reflections of the sky.
  • Symbolic detail: small paw and sand marks near the big stones to hint at the squirrel’s work.
  • Light: warm, golden light (early morning or late afternoon) gently highlighting Rama and the squirrel, emphasizing grace and inclusion.

- Visual Style & Mood
  • Soft, painterly style with clear facial expressions and gentle textures.
  • Warm, devotional palette: golds, soft blues, muted browns, and greens.
  • Atmosphere of tenderness, humility, and the idea that even the smallest effort in devotion matters.
  • No text inside the image; let the composition, light, and expressions tell the story.

The final image should make a viewer immediately feel that Rama values the squirrel’s tiny contribution as much as the Vanaras’ great strength, symbolizing that sincere devotion, however small, is accepted and honored.
