# Movie Set Optimization System

A tool for analyzing historical settings and optimizing film/TV production costs by determining what should be physically built versus created with CGI.

⚠️ NOTE: This code is provided as a conceptual implementation only.

## Overview

This system helps production teams make data-driven decisions about set construction by:

1. Analyzing uploaded images of historical settings
2. Breaking down elements into physical vs. CGI construction requirements
3. Estimating construction costs based on budget constraints
4. Generating visual mockups of both the minimal physical set and final composited shot

## Features

- **Automated Set Analysis**: Uses AI to identify architectural and environmental elements
- **Budget Optimization**: Determines the most cost-effective balance between physical and CGI elements
- **Visual Previews**: Generates mockups of both the physical set and final shot
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Creates detailed HTML reports with budget analysis and construction plans

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o and GPT Image models
- Required packages:
  - openai
  - pillow
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install openai pillow matplotlib numpy
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key when prompted

## Usage

1. Upload an image of a historical setting (e.g., Colosseum, ancient temple)
2. Enter basic information:
   - Name of the historical setting
   - Historical period
   - Production type (Feature Film, TV Series, etc.)
   - Description of a key scene
   - Budget constraints
3. The system will:
   - Analyze the setting and identify key elements
   - Determine what should be physically built vs. created with CGI
   - Generate visualizations of both the physical set and final composite
   - Create a budget chart and comprehensive report

## How It Works

### 1. Image Analysis

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision model to analyze the uploaded image and identify:
- All architectural and environmental elements
- Elements actors would interact with
- Elements in foreground, midground, and background
- Recommended camera angles

### 2. Construction Planning

Based on the analysis and budget constraints, the system determines:
- Which elements should be physically built
- Which elements should be created with CGI
- Estimated construction costs
- Reasoning for these decisions

### 3. Visualization Generation

Using OpenAI's GPT Image model, the system generates:
- A visualization of the minimal physical set with construction annotations
- A visualization of the final composited shot with all CGI elements
- A side-by-side comparison image

### 4. Reporting

The system creates a comprehensive HTML report containing:
- Project overview and key information
- Budget analysis with charts
- Construction plans and reasoning
- All generated visualizations

## Example Output

The system produces several output files:
- `physical_set.jpg`: Visualization of the physical construction elements
- `composite_shot.jpg`: Visualization of the final shot with CGI elements
- `set_comparison.jpg`: Side-by-side comparison of physical vs. composite
- `budget_chart.jpg`: Visual representation of budget allocation
- `set_optimization_report.html`: Comprehensive report with all analyses

## Use Cases

- Pre-production planning for historical films and TV shows
- Budget optimization for production companies
- Visual effects planning and coordination
- Production design concept development
- Location scouting decision support

## Limitations

- Accuracy depends on the quality of the uploaded image
- Cost estimates are approximate and should be verified by production professionals
- Generated visualizations are conceptual and may not reflect final production quality
- Processing time can vary based on image complexity and API response times

## Future Improvements

- Support for multiple camera angle simulations
- Integration with 3D modeling software
- More detailed construction cost breakdown
- Support for video input for dynamic scenes
- Collaboration features for production teams
