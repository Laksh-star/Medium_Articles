This doctrine aimed to ensure that different viewpoints were represented in media, much like current efforts to manage misinformation on social media. However, it was abolished in 1987 due to concerns about its impact on free speech and the changing media landscape.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **The Communications Decency Act (1996)**: Section 230 of this act has been pivotal in shaping the internet by providing immunity to online platforms from liability for user-generated content. This legal framework has allowed social media platforms to moderate content without being treated as publishers, similar to the current debates on how much influence the government should have over content moderation.\n",

The Permanent Settlement of 1793, for instance, led to numerous conflicts over land ownership and rights, as it altered traditional landholding patterns and prioritized revenue collection over local customs.\n",
            "   - **Environmental Movements in India**: The Chipko Movement of the 1970s is a notable historical precedent where local communities, particularly women, protested against deforestation and environmental degradation in the Himalayan region. This movement highlighted the tension between development and environmental conservation, similar to the current HCU issue.\n",
            "   - **University Protests in India**: Indian universities have historically been centers of political and social activism. The student protests during the Emergency period (1975-1977) and more recent movements like the anti-CAA protests in 2019-2020 showcase the role of students in advocating for social justice and environmental issues.\n",

            "   - **Differences**:\n",
            "     - Unlike colonial land disputes, which were often resolved through top-down decisions by colonial authorities, the HCU issue is being addressed through legal challenges and democratic processes.\n",
            "     - The current situation involves modern legal frameworks like the Forest Conservation Act, which were not present during earlier environmental movements.\n",
