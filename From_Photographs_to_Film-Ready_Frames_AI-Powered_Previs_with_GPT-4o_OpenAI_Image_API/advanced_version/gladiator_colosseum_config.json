Senators in the imperial box look down with interest as MAXIMUS grips his gladius sword and shield, turning slowly to face his opponent across the blood-stained sand."

The crowd leans forward, straining to hear his verdict over the occasional cry of an exotic beast waiting in the cages below."

They circle each other beneath the sweltering sun, the crowd's chants echoing off the towering walls. MAXIMUS stumbles against a wooden barricade, narrowly avoiding a killing blow, then rolls across the ground, grabbing a handful of sand to throw in his opponent's face."

The crowd erupts in deafening cheers as he throws his sword into the sand. From the upper tiers to the front rows, spectators bang their feet and call his name while guards eye him warily from the arena entrances."
