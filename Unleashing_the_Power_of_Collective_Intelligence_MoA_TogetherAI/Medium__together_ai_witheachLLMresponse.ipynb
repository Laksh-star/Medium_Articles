            "1. **Bhagavad Gita**: The Bhagavad Gita, a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata, is perhaps the most well-known source for the concept of Karma Yoga. In the Gita, Krishna teaches Arjuna about the importance of performing one's duty (dharma) without attachment to the results of actions (nishkam karma). He emphasizes that one should act selflessly, without desire for personal gain, and with a sense of devotion (bhakti). Karma Yoga, as described in the Gita, is about dedicating one's actions to a higher divinity or purpose, thereby transcending the cycle of karma.\n",

The story illustrates that even a person involved in traditionally 'unclean' professions can attain spiritual purity and enlightenment through the practice of Karma Yoga. The Vyadha Gita emphasizes the importance of performing one's duties with a pure heart, without attachment to the fruits of one's actions.\n",

            "3. **Yoga Vasistha**: The Yoga Vasistha is a Hindu scripture that delves into various aspects of yoga, including Karma Yoga. In this text, the concept of Karma Yoga is closely tied to the understanding of the true nature of reality (Brahman) and the self (Atman). It teaches that by performing actions with a clear and pure mind, one can transcend the limitations of the ego and merge with the universal consciousness. The Yoga Vasistha emphasizes the importance of detachment, wisdom, and dispassion in the practice of Karma Yoga.\n",

The butcher explains that he performs his work without attachment to the results and with a pure heart, which leads to his spiritual growth. This underscores the idea that any work, when done selflessly, can be a form of worship and lead to spiritual progress.\n",
